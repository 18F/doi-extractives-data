ANCSA granted 44 million acres (both surface and sub-surface) and 1 billion dollars to 12 regional native corporations and 220 village corporations. These village and regional corporations now own 12% of land in Alaska; non-native private lands in Alaska make up just 1% of the land in the state.</p>\\n<p>These private, for-profit corporations belong to and benefit Alaska Natives in their region or village, but are distinct from tribes. Alaska Natives were allotted shares in Alaska Native corporations when the corporations were created. Unlike shares in a publicly traded corporation, however, Alaska Native corporation shares cannot be traded or sold.</p>\\n<p>Alaska Native corporations have generated substantial revenues from resource development, though this exposes them to the same revenue sustainability questions that affect <a href=\\\"#revenue-sustainability\\\">state revenues</a>. ANCSA provides for natural revenue sharing among all ANCs, so ANCs may mutually support each other to help smooth revenue volatility: For example, the <a href=\\\"http://www.nana.com/regional/resources/red-dog-mine/\\\">Red Dog zinc mine</a> has generated $1.3 billion in net proceeds for NANA Regional Corporation since mining began. It has retained about $480 million and shared about $820 million with other ANCs. Of the $480 million retained, about $221 million has been paid out to individual shareholders as dividends.</p>\\n<p>Separately from the Alaska Native corporations, there are <a href=\\\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/01/29/2016-01769/indian-entities-recognized-and-eligible-to-receive-services-from-the-united-states-bureau-of-indian#h-7\\\">229 federally recognized tribal entities</a> in Alaska.

The state selected 103 million acres of land and was granted an additional 1.2 million acres in trust lands; Alaska also owns all mineral rights in its acreage.</p>\\n<p>The state of Alaska is the second largest landowner in the state (after the U.S. government).

ANCSA granted 44 million acres (both surface and sub-surface) and 1 billion dollars to 12 regional native corporations and 220 village corporations. These village and regional corporations now own 12% of land in Alaska; non-native private lands in Alaska make up just 1% of the land in the state.</p>\\n<p>These private, for-profit corporations belong to and benefit Alaska Natives in their region or village, but are distinct from tribes. Alaska Natives were allotted shares in Alaska Native corporations when the corporations were created. Unlike shares in a publicly traded corporation, however, Alaska Native corporation shares cannot be traded or sold.</p>\\n<p>Alaska Native corporations have generated substantial revenues from resource development, though this exposes them to the same revenue sustainability questions that affect <a href=\\\"#revenue-sustainability\\\">state revenues</a>. ANCSA provides for natural revenue sharing among all ANCs, so ANCs may mutually support each other to help smooth revenue volatility: For example, the <a href=\\\"http://www.nana.com/regional/resources/red-dog-mine/\\\">Red Dog zinc mine</a> has generated $1.3 billion in net proceeds for NANA Regional Corporation since mining began.

Development and activity related to the extractive industries are concentrated on Alaska's northern coast, so attention to costs is concentrated in that part of the state.</p>\\n<p>For a holistic look at how the North Slope Borough has met the transportation, water, emergency services, and reclamation needs of extractive industries, see [the North Slope Borough case study]({{ site.baseurl }}/case-studies/north-slope/#costs).</p>\\n<p>Multiple organizations in the Alaska state government work on the reclamation and remediation of sites related to extraction. The Alaska state government invests significant tax dollars to prevent and respond to oil and hazardous substance emergencies, including reclamation services such as managing contaminated drilling sites. The <a href=\\\"https://dec.alaska.gov/spar/rfa/history.htm\\\">Oil and Hazardous Substance Release Prevention and Response Fund</a> imposes a 4 cent surcharge per barrel of oil for prevention, and a 1 cent surcharge per barrel of oil for response. The <a href=\\\"https://dec.alaska.gov/spar/\\\">Division of Spill Prevention and Response (SPAR)</a> had a total operating budget of $19.9 million in fiscal year 2016. $12.3 million of that went to spill prevention and response in fiscal year 2016.</p>\\n<p>The DNR Mining, Land, and Water’s <a href=\\\"http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/aml/\\\">Abandoned Mine Lands Program</a> administers the federal AML program in Alaska for coal and select hard rock reclamation projects. The program estimated in May of 2014 that 15 coal projects and 8 non-coal projects remained to be reclaimed. Alaska is a Minimum Program state, meaning it receives $3 million a year from the <a href=\\\"http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/aml/\\\">federal Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation program</a>, with the funds coming from fees paid by current coal mine operators. <a href=\\\"http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/aml/\\\">See examples of AML projects</a>.</p>\"}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/explore-ak.json\n// module id = 901\n// module chunks = 39807438965472"],"sourceRoot":""}
