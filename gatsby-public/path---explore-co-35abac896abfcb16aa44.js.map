Additionally, according to a Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) study, the load impact of trucks used in extraction can be as much as 15,000 to 46,000 times that of a passenger car. Oil and gas loads are estimated to be 3-10% of total loads on the Colorado highway system.</p>\\n<p>According to CDOT, the estimated cost to offset the impact of the oil and gas extraction on state roads and highways ranges from $10 to $30 million, which is up to 13% of the CDOT’s annual surface treatment budget.

This can lead to increased rates and the need for infrastructure investments. Oil and gas extraction in Colorado reported using approximately 6.7 billion gallons of water from 2011-2013. Additionally, COGCC found that extractive activities produced 304,451,972 BBL of water in 2016, 0.006% of which was spilled.</p>\\n<p>In addition to water use and production, the environmental and engineering staff of the COGCC also monitor and assess water quality in Colorado. Currently, they are investigating 22 instances of Thermogenic stray gas impacts in domestic water wells in the Denver-Julesberg basin. Additionally, the state, through the Department of Public Health and Environment, also has multiple large remediation obligations related to the extractive industry, including a total of: $57 million at Summerville Mine operating a water treatment plant, $64.8 million at Clear Creek Basin cleaning up metal mine contaminated surface water, and $5.5 million at Captain Jack Mill addressing mine waste piles and drainage.

Reclamation efforts in Colorado are led by the Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining, and Safety (DRMS) which works to reclaim <a href=\\\"http://mining.state.co.us/Reports/Reports/Pages/AML.aspx\\\">abandoned</a> and <a href=\\\"http://mining.state.co.us/Programs/Abandoned/Pages/impwelcomepage.aspx\\\">inactive</a> mines. DRMS has reclaimed 6,127 of the estimated 23,000 abandoned mines in Colorado. In 2017, Colorado received $2,793,000 from the federal AML Program, sourced from fees paid by coal mine operators, in line with the historic annual average. The average cost for closing a hazardous abandoned mine feature is $5,000.

Priority 1 abandoned mine land (AML) areas, the highest priority, account for $41.5 million (or 55.2%) of those unfunded costs. Priority 1 AML areas are those that are necessary to reclaim in order to protect public health, safety, and property from extreme danger of adverse effects of coal mining practices pre-1977. This can include restoration of land, water, and/or the environment.</p>\\n<p>As of June 2017, $4.2 million in reclamation work was underway and $63.2 million had been completed across the three priority types.</p>\"}}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---explore-co-35abac896abfcb16aa44.js","module.exports = {\"pathContext\":{\"stateMarkdown\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Colorado\",\"unique_id\":\"CO\",\"is_cropped\":true,\"nearby_offshore_region\":null,\"opt_in\":true,\"state_optin_intro\":null,\"case_study_link\":null,\"locality_name\":null,\"state_revenue_year\":2016,\"priority\":null,\"neighbors\":null},\"fields\":{\"case_study_link_htmlAst\":null,\"state_optin_intro_htmlAst\":null,\"state_production_htmlAst\":null,\"state_land_htmlAst\":\"{\\\"type\\\":\\\"root\\\",\\\"children\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"element\\\",\\\"tagName\\\":\\\"p\\\",\\\"properties\\\":{},\\\"children\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"text\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"The state of Colorado covers over 66.5 million acres.

Attention to and analysis of costs is, therefore, focused on these areas.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"transportation-costs\\\"><a href=\\\"#transportation-costs\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Transportation costs</h4>\\n<p>Extractive activities have resulted in not only more traffic on Colorado roads and highways, but also greater loads on the state’s transportation infrastructure. In certain areas, such as Highway 85C between Fort Lupton and Platteville, traffic has increased by 58.72% over a five year period due to oil and gas development. Additionally, according to a Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) study, the load impact of trucks used in extraction can be as much as 15,000 to 46,000 times that of a passenger car. Oil and gas loads are estimated to be 3-10% of total loads on the Colorado highway system.</p>\\n<p>According to CDOT, the estimated cost to offset the impact of the oil and gas extraction on state roads and highways ranges from $10 to $30 million, which is up to 13% of the CDOT’s annual surface treatment budget.

This can lead to increased rates and the need for infrastructure investments. Oil and gas extraction in Colorado reported using approximately 6.7 billion gallons of water from 2011-2013. Additionally, COGCC found that extractive activities produced 304,451,972 BBL of water in 2016, 0.006% of which was spilled.</p>\\n<p>In addition to water use and production, the environmental and engineering staff of the COGCC also monitor and assess water quality in Colorado. Currently, they are investigating 22 instances of Thermogenic stray gas impacts in domestic water wells in the Denver-Julesberg basin. Additionally, the state, through the Department of Public Health and Environment, also has multiple large remediation obligations related to the extractive industry, including a total of: $57 million at Summerville Mine operating a water treatment plant, $64.8 million at Clear Creek Basin cleaning up metal mine contaminated surface water, and $5.5 million at Captain Jack Mill addressing mine waste piles and drainage.

Though the exact number of such incidents is not published by the government, general incidents and complaints can be searched through the <a href=\\\"http://cogcc.state.co.us/data.html\\\">Colorado Oil and Gas Information System</a>.

The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment’s Division of Oil and Public Safety oversees cleanup of petroleum released from regulated underground storage tanks. Finally, the Colorado Department of Transportation oversees spill incidents within Colorado highways and beyond.</p>\\n<p>Colorado has not been “certified” by the federal [Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation program]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/aml-reclamation-program/), meaning that it has remaining high-priority abandoned coal mine areas. Reclamation efforts in Colorado are led by the Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining, and Safety (DRMS) which works to reclaim <a href=\\\"http://mining.state.co.us/Reports/Reports/Pages/AML.aspx\\\">abandoned</a> and <a href=\\\"http://mining.state.co.us/Programs/Abandoned/Pages/impwelcomepage.aspx\\\">inactive</a> mines. DRMS has reclaimed 6,127 of the estimated 23,000 abandoned mines in Colorado. In 2017, Colorado received $2,793,000 from the federal AML Program, sourced from fees paid by coal mine operators, in line with the historic annual average. The average cost for closing a hazardous abandoned mine feature is $5,000. An <a href=\\\"http://mining.state.co.us/Programs/Abandoned/Reclamation/Pages/OurProgram&#x27;sHistory-Colorado&#x27;sHistory.aspx\\\">overview of DRMS’ history and work can be found here</a>.</p>\\n<p>Colorado currently has $75.3 million in unfunded abandoned mine land areas in need of reclamation. Priority 1 abandoned mine land (AML) areas, the highest priority, account for $41.5 million (or 55.2%) of those unfunded costs. Priority 1 AML areas are those that are necessary to reclaim in order to protect public health, safety, and property from extreme danger of adverse effects of coal mining practices pre-1977. This can include restoration of land, water, and/or the environment.</p>\\n<p>As of June 2017, $4.2 million in reclamation work was underway and $63.2 million had been completed across the three priority types.</p>\"}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/explore-co.json\n// module id = 906\n// module chunks = 7585504090183"],"sourceRoot":""}
