    <p>When companies extract natural resources on federal land, they pay royalties, rents, bonuses, and other fees — much like they would to any landowner. They also have to report more data about their activities on government-owned land than on private land.

  <section id="process">
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>When companies extract natural resources on federal land, they follow laws or policies that govern how rights are awarded and what fees they pay to the government. The specifics of the process depend on the kind of resource, and often affect how much revenue the federal government ultimately collects.</p>
    <p>For details, read more about the different processes for awarding rights and extracting resources: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/coal/">coal</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/onshore-oil-gas/">oil and gas</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/onshore-renewables/">renewable resources</a>, and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/minerals/">hardrock minerals</a>.</p>

  <section id="revenue" class="federal revenue">
    <h2>Revenue</h2>

    <p>When companies want to extract natural resources on federal land, they pay fees depending on where they are in the process of using the land. For instance, a company might pay for the right to explore for resources, pay rent while exploring the land, and then pay a percentage of production value once they start producing resources on the land.</p>

    <p>{{ site.data.land_stats[state_id].federal_percent | percent }} percent of land in {{ state_name }} is owned by the federal government.</p>

      <p>Companies may not know whether they’ll produce oil or gas until they explore the land, so fees are not differentiated by product until production begins.</p>
