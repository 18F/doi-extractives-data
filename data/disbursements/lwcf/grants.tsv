This general area was designated in 1970 as the Blood Run National Historic Landmark. In 2000 a congressionally authorized National Park Service Special Resources Study recommended expansion of the NHL boundary and protection of nationally significant cultural resources, including burial mounds, pitted rocks, and village sites. This site represents the largest documented site of the Oneota culture. At one time, it is believed, that the site functioned as a ceremonial and trade center playing a major role in the control and distribution of catlinite from quarries at the Pipestone National Monument located 40 miles northeast. Catlinite is a soft, easily carved stone that was used like currency and widely traded, and has been found all across North America and is still used today. This area provided shelter from inclement weather and an abundance of food sources in the form of wild game and plant species. As a record of more recent history, a monument on the property memorializes the first white child born in Lincoln County. The property consists of wooded river bluffs that rise over 160 feet above the Big Sioux River floodplain to rolling farmland at the western side of the property. Proposed short term (within 18 months) development goals for this area include basic items like creating public access sites, constructing a trailhead and trail, an information kiosk, a vault toilet, and a drinking fountain. The State’s proposed long term development goals include a visitor center, amphitheater, and interpretive opportunities within the park and canoe access to the Big Sioux River.

OF PARKS & WILDLIFE	The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department will utilize a Land and Water Conservation Fund grant to assist in acquiring [fee simple title] 113.58 acres contiguous to Garner State Park in Uvalde County. Completion of this proposal will result in permanent protection and management of ecologically significant interdistributory ridges plus critical habitat for the federally listed and endangered Black-capped Vireo and the Golden-cheeked Warbler, which is the only breeding songbird endemic entirely to Texas. The acquisition will create an opportunity to add miles of potential hiking trails and primitive camping to the state park. The new parcel contains beautiful ridge-top vistas, and canyons. The most popular current hike for park guests is the trail leading to the peak of Old Baldy which is adjacent to the parcel being acquired. The acquisition of this tract will allow for an extension of ridge trails along the Park’s southern boundary. Garner State Park is considered one of the Texas State Park system’s gems and has more visitations and overnight camping than any other Texas State Park. But at only 1, 660 acres, the ability of the site to accommodate more visitors and to meet the growing recreation demands is very limited.	GARNER STATE PARK	UVALDE	23	1,773.70

This acquisition will in turn facilitate the later acquisition (in fee title) to the entire 17,638-acre Devil's River Ranch which consists of native riparian woodlands, Edwards Plateau oak woodlands and grasslands, and Tamaulipan and Chihuahuan desert scrub habitat with ten miles of Devil’s River frontage and adjacent to the Amistad National Recreation Area. The overall project will eventually result in the permanent protection and management of important grasslands and woodlands, riverine and riparian habitats, and world-class prehistoric rock art sites. Furthermore, the acquisition will provide managed public access to the wildest and most pristine river in Texas, and one of the most unspoiled rivers in the continental United States. TPWD has continued to explore ways to make this spectacular landscape accessible to a wider audience while improving control and management of visitation and human impacts on the river and watershed. This strategic property, at the confluence of the Devils River and Amistad Reservoir, results in a unique opportunity for TPWD to manage access while providing a range of low impact recreational opportunities including fishing, hunting, paddling and wilderness experiences.

The property includes more than 2 miles of frontage on North Palo Pinto Creek, a modest perennial stream that contributes significantly to the site’s diversity with aquatic and emergent habitats and a forested riparian corridor. Perhaps the most significant feature from a recreational standpoint is that the site straddles the Palo Pinto Mountains, a string of sandy limestone hills and breaks. This grant will result in permanent protection and management of ecologically noteworthy habitat that includes limestone hills, cliffs, and canyons, aquatic and emergent habitats along North Palo Pinto Creek, and potential habitat for the federally listed endangered Golden-cheeked Warbler; Texas’ only endemic songbird. This new north Texas State Park is located about an hours’ drive west from the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex.	NEW STATE PARK	MULTI-COUNTY	99	1,359.00

The Laguna Madre is a 110-mile long saltwater lagoon separating Padre Island from the South Texas mainland. It covers 609 square miles of estuarine and coastal marine systems. Submerged lands, marshes, spoil islands, variable salinity and depths, including the variety of sea grasses, make the Laguna Madre a unique natural community. The new park will initially be developed with a 16-foot wide, single lane boat ramp with twenty 10 ft. x 40 foot parking spaces for vehicles and trailers, a lighted t-head fishing pier, a family fishing dock, a playground, a kayak launch, shoreline boardwalks, a habitat boardwalk with interpretive signs, entry and connecting trails, picnic shelters with picnic tables, and trash receptacles. The project site is part of a unique and rare assemblage of South Texas habitats and represents some of the last undeveloped publicly accessible sites on the Laguna Madre. The proposed improvements will substantially increase access to the site while reducing damage to sensitive wetlands and coastal natural resource areas caused by past unmanaged and uncontrolled use of the site.
