an additional 125,000 acres of land, of which approximately 76,473 acres are privately owned. The act
authorized the Secretary of the Interior to acquire such privately owned land from a willing seller, by
donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange. The Service’s appropriation for 2010
included $4,575,000 for acquisition of Twin Buttes Ranch that was among the lands added to the park in
2004. This is the first funding to be directed to this project.
Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Petrified Forest National Park contains globally
significant fossil from the Late Triassic Period. The park is a virtual laboratory offering opportunities for
paleontological research and visitor understanding that are unparalleled. The conservation and protection
of the fossil resources, especially petrified wood (critical park resource) is the reason for the original
establishment of the park, while the protection of vast cultural resources (the secondary unit resource) is
a major focus and the intent of later expansion legislation.
Threat: Direct threats to natural and cultural resources in the proposed expansion area include theft and
vandalism of fragile and non-renewable archaeological and paleontological sites and resources. Although
these occurrences are all within the park’s congressionally approved administrative boundary, the park
currently has no jurisdiction over these lands and therefore non-renewable paleontological and
archaeological resources are unattended and subject to ongoing theft and vandalism.
Need: The funds requested would be used to complete acquisition of Twin Buttes Ranch and NZ Milky
Ranch. The remainder would be obligated to commence acquisition of the Paulsell Ranch that includes
numerous significant cultural sites including rock art panels, as well as structures from the Puebloan
period of southwest. This property also includes nine miles of the Puerco River Riparian area. The Puerco
River Riparian Area provides crucial habitat for many of the species found in this area from insects and
rodents to raptors and migrating elk.
Letters of support for this project have been received by the cities of Holbrook and Winslow, Arizona, the
State of Arizona, Arizona Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Navajo Nation, the Hopi Tribe, and the
Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.
This acquisition will serve to protect riparian habitat and watershed resources and preserves an
overarching natural landscape and significant American cultural and historic resources."	 N/A 	 N/A

Cooperators: U.S. Forest Service, California Department of Fish and Game, Cities of Palm Desert, Palm Springs, Cathedral City, City of Rancho Mirage, Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians, Coachella Valley Mountains Conservancy, The Nature Conservancy.

Project Description: Providing a rugged backdrop to the gateway communities of Palm Springs, Palm Desert and La Quinta, the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument (NM) hosted approximately 1,500,000 visitors in 2008. However, rapid urbanization, immediately adjacent to the Monument, ironically is threatening the tremendous scenic and wildlife resource values, which helped to establish these resort communities in the early 1900’s.

Encompassing 272,000 acres, the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains NM is a series of steep escarpments, ranging from sea level to nearly 11,000 feet in elevation.  This undeveloped “island” is home to over 600 animal and plant species, residing within several distinct climatic zones. Numerous threatened and endangered species, including one of the nation’s largest herds of Peninsular bighorn sheep, the least Bell’s vireo, populations of desert tortoise and desert slender salamander, and unique fan palm oases, are found among the area’s perennial streams, springs and seeps. The Monument is within the Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan.

The Monument is co-administered by the BLM and Forest Service (64,400 acres of the Monument lie within the San Bernardino National Forest). Three Wilderness areas, the 94,989-acre Santa Rosa Mountain Wilderness, administered by BLM, and the 19,695-acre Santa Rosa Wilderness and a portion of the 33,177-acre San Jacinto Wilderness, administered by the Forest Service are imbedded within the Monument boundary. The 2,683-mile Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail passes through the Monument.
Purpose
Conserve significant scenic, recreational, and wilderness resources within the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument. Increase recreational access/public use.
Purchase
Opportunities
Multiple properties facing immediate threat from high-density suburban/urban residential development and incompatible recreational use and demands.

outstanding historic, scenic, and recreational values. The Act of December 20, 2005 (Public Law 109-
131), revised the boundary to include approximately 4,500 acres of additional land known as the ‘Rancho
Corral de Tierra Additions’ and authorized the acquisition of those lands only from a willing seller. The
land features mountain peaks, coastal watersheds, threatened and endangered habitats, historic ranch
landscape and structures, and potential for recreational enjoyment related to trails. The tract provides a
key corridor to connect the Congressionally-designated Bay Area Ridge Trail with the California Coastal
Trail and is accessible to more than 6 million people who live within a one hour drive.
Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The national recreation area encompasses
shoreline areas of San Francisco, Marin, and San Mateo Counties, including ocean beaches, redwood
forest, lagoons, marshes, military properties, a cultural center at Fort Mason, and Alcatraz Island.
Threat: Intense pressure to develop open space in the San Francisco area threatens the integrity of the
national recreation area.
Need: In combination with previously appropriated funds, the requested funding level will be obligated to
complete the acquisition of a 4,076-acre, largely undeveloped parcel that was added to the national
recreation area in 2005. It is expected that the requested funds will permit acquisition of the final 1,500-
acre portion of the property. This property was privately owned until purchased for approximately $30
million in 2003 by Peninsula Open Space Trust, a non-profit conservation organization. In light of a
bargain sale offered by the Trust, the Federal share of the total acquisition cost is expected to be
approximately $15 million. The FY 2009 appropriation included $4,000,000 for the acquisition; the FY
2010 appropriation included an additional $5,000,000.
This acquisition project has seen strong local support. The matching funds raised by Peninsula Open
Space Trust are evidence of such support.

by donation, purchase, or exchange. As of December 31, 2009, the preserve contains a total of 1,535,199
acres, of which 26,703 acres are privately owned. .
Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The preserve protects the fragile habitat of the desert
tortoise, vast open spaces, and historic mining scenes such as the Kelso railroad depot.
Threat: Unchecked development threatens the significant natural, scenic, and archeological resources in the
core of the preserve and along the southern and eastern gateways.
Need: The requested funds will be used to acquire eight tracts totaling 846 acres that surround the park’s
main visitor use center within a significant designated historic district in the middle of the preserve. The
park’s enabling legislation recognized the importance of this historic district and specifically suggested
that the Kelso train depot be used as the new park’s central visitor center. The subject tracts carry a
threat of potential development that would destroy the historic scene and impact the district. Developers
for commercial and industrial uses are currently considering these parcels. In addition, due to natural
drainage in the vicinity of the historic depot, some private lands that lie between the depot and the
adjacent large desert wash may be instrumental to flood protection for the historic structures and other
historic resources.

scenic, natural, and historic values of the area, and to preserve its public health value as an airshed for
southern California metropolitan areas while providing recreational and educational opportunities. To date,
funds in the amount of $162,836,118 have been appropriated for land acquisition at the area. The State of
California and other conservation groups have also spent over $269.5 million for land acquisition within the
park boundaries. After fiscal year 2010, approximately 20,881 acres of privately owned land will remain to
be acquired.
Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The national recreation area contains excellent
examples of Mediterranean-type ecosystems not well represented in other areas of the National Park
System. There are outstanding landforms and habitats, and rare biological and geological resources. The
area provides natural habitat necessary to the survival of species such as the mountain lion. There are
abundant fossil deposits and outstanding scenery. Cultural resources include remnants of the Gabrielino
and Chumash cultures.
Threat: Residential and commercial developments threaten the resources of the area and reduce
recreational opportunities.
Need: The requested funds will permit the acquisition of 16 tracts totaling 286.01 acres of land within the
national recreation area needed to ensure the preservation of the 9,000-acre core habitat area in Zuma
and Trancas Canyons. If these tracts are developed as residential properties, the damage to the local
ecosystem would be irreversible. Removal of the undisturbed shrub community will open the way for
establishment of invasive non-native plant species.
Letters of support for these acquisitions have been provided by 12 local city governments (cities of
Malibu, Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village, Santa Monica, Los Angeles, Calabasas, Agoura Hills, Hidden

Subsequently the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act, Big Sur Wilderness and Conservation Act of 2002, Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Act of 2006, and most recently the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 have designated 19 additional Wilderness units on BLM lands in California. These Wilderness units stretch from the north coast of California to the peaks of the Sierra Nevada to lands along the Mexican border. 

Over 37 million people are now living in California. These Wilderness units offer places of solitude where people can experience freedom from our fast-paced industrialized society. They are places where people can renew the human spirit through association with the natural world and offer a respite from the pressure of an ever increasing urban lifestyle. 

More than half of the South Fork Eel River Wilderness is characterized by reddish soil. This unusual soil has resulted in a unique vegetation cover with several Federally and State protected botanical species, including endangered, candidate, and BLM sensitive species.

The Act of September 25, 1986, established a permanent boundary and authorized the acquisition of conservation easements on certain islands adjacent to the park.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal:  Situated on the Maine coast in the heart of the old region of Acadia, the park conserves mountains and rugged islands that are unequaled along the eastern seaboard.  The northern coniferous and temperate deciduous forests meet and overlap, bringing together nearly 1,500 species of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plant life.

Threat:  Little of New England's rockbound coast remains in public ownership, undeveloped and natural.  The primary threat to park resources is the development of previously undeveloped land, an action not compatible with preserving the natural and scenic resources of the area.

Need:  The requested funds are needed to acquire a 22.9-acre tract of land that borders Round Pond and is located in a very secluded section of Mount Desert Island within the park boundary.  At present, approximately half of the shore frontage around Round Pond is federally owned and protected.  The remainder of the shore and lands surrounding the pond is currently undeveloped, including this acquisition parcel. Given the size and character of this parcel, if not acquired by the National Park Service, there is a high likelihood it will be sold and subdivided into small house lots within two years.  Such a development would significantly degrade this important habitat and wildlife corridor.

The acquisition of lands within the boundary of Acadia National Park, with the consent of the owner, is strongly supported by the local community, Chambers of Commerce, and non-profit conservation organizations, such as Downeast Audubon, Maine Coast Heritage Trust, and Friends of Acadia.  Maine Coast Heritage Trust is working with the owner to complete this acquisition.

been underway since fiscal year 1972. Of the 218,200 acres comprising the park, only 1,155 acres remain
privately owned. Approximately 1,014 acres of privately owned land have been identified for acquisition
after fiscal year 2010.
Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The park was established to preserve and protect the
outstanding scenery, geological conditions, and waterway systems that constituted part of the historic route
of the voyageurs who contributed to the opening of the United States. The park contains more than 30 lakes
dotted with islands and surrounded by forests.
Threat: Threats of recreational and residential development require expeditious completion of the acquisition
program at the park.
Need: For fiscal year 2011, $366,500 are needed to acquire a 3.5-acre tract of privately owned land
located adjacent to an active bald eagle nesting site and near the primary gateway water entrance into
the north half of the park. Acquisition is necessary to permit the removal of structures to return the site to
a more natural condition and minimize disturbance to nesting activity. In addition the structures on site are
susceptible to use for continued hunting on the tract due to the absent landowner.
The tract was acquired in 2008 by the Parks and Trails Council of Minnesota, a non-profit conservation
organization. The intent of the Council’s action was to temporarily secure and hold ownership of the tract
until the appropriation of sufficient funds would permit Federal acquisition. Without assurance that such
an appropriation is forthcoming, the Council, due to financial hardship, may place the property on sale
again. Such a result would jeopardize the likelihood of future cooperative ventures with the Council.
This acquisition will serve to protect riparian habitat and watershed resources in conjunction with NPS

Project Description: The Service would use the requested funds to purchase 670 acres that would be for
the initial phase of a multi-year acquisition effort to acquire one of the most important tracts remaining
within Red Rock Lakes NWR. The Elizabeth Grazing Association tract includes nearly 1 mile on both
sides of Red Rock Creek that supplies most of the water for the Red Rock Lakes NWR wetland complex.
Acquisition of this property would enable the Service to restore this portion of Red Rock Creek (from
overgrazing) and improve water quality in Upper Red Rock Lake on the refuge. The Centennial Valley,
like much of western Montana, is threatened by subdivision and demand for second home development
that is creeping west from Yellowstone Park and the Henry’s Lake portion of northern Idaho (this tract
could easily be developed into recreational home sites). The subject property includes a large riparian
wetland complex that provides habitat for 21 species of waterfowl and 35 species of other wetland dependent
birds. Acquisition of this tract would expand opportunities for wildlife-dependent forms of
public recreation on the east end of the refuge."	 -   	 10,000 	"O & M: The Service would spend a minimal amount for easement monitoring and inspections, estimated

Project Description: The requested funds would allow the Service to acquire 14,286 acres in fee title
from multiple owners for perpetual easements and allow the land to remain in native grassland to keep the
ecosystem intact. There is a backlog of over 100 willing sellers to keep land in native grassland habitat.
The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) ecosystem contains native mixed-grass prairie intermingled with high
densities of temporary, semi-permanent and permanent wetlands and supports some of the highest
breeding waterfowl and shorebird populations in North America, including the endangered piping plover.
The grassland easement prevents the conversion of grassland and primarily focuses on large blocks of
native grassland habitat. This landscape level ecosystem protection maintains the natural habitat,
provides long-term viability, and improves its health for the benefit of wildlife and people; while at the
same time allows private ownership with restricted uses.
Habitat fragmentation remains the greatest threat to PPR habitat. Conversion of grassland to cropland for
bio-fuels production and loss of Conservation Reserve Program acres diminishes the natural function of
the PPR ecosystem and its productivity for wildlife. Grassland loss rates in some areas have reached two
percent a year. With the protection afforded by perpetual grassland easements, this highly productive yet
fragile ecosystem would remain intact, preserving habitat where biological communities can flourish."	 -   	 2,000 	"O & M: The Service anticipates spending a minimal amount for annual compliance over-flights,

historic site on January 15, 1944. A gift from President Roosevelt, the site then consisted of 33 acres
containing the home, outbuildings, and the grave site. The Secretary of the Interior accepted title to the site
on November 21, 1945. The site was formally dedicated on April 12, 1946, the first anniversary of the
President’s death.
Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The park preserves and protects the birthplace,
lifetime residence, and “Summer White House” of the 32nd President. The gravesites of President and Mrs.
Roosevelt are in the Rose Garden.
Threat: The estate home of Franklin D. Roosevelt formerly encompassed approximately 1,200 acres in
Hyde Park, New York. However, the national historic site today contains only 792 acres. Recognizing the
need to protect more of the original estate from development, legislation was enacted in 1998 to permit the
Federal acquisition of additional portions of the original estate. Public Law 105-364 of November 10, 1998,
authorized acquisition by purchase with donated or appropriated funds, by donation, or otherwise, of
lands and interests located in Hyde Park, New York, and owned by FDR or his family at the time of his
death. Such lands are to be added, upon acquisition, to the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National
Historic Site or Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site, as appropriate.
Need: For fiscal year 2011, funds in the amount of $1,575,000 are needed to acquire a 1.5-acre tract,
owned by the Franklin & Eleanor Roosevelt Institute (FERI) that includes an historic structure built in the
1830's and later occupied by the Roosevelt family and owned by FDR at the time of his death. This
structure was renovated for use as a residence for FERI staff. The structure is visible from the FDR’s
home Springwood, a distance of only 650 feet. A change in land use or character would have a direct and
negative impact upon the park visitors' experience. The threat is imminent because the owner (FERI) has
put the property on the market. Once acquired, the National Park Service would enter into an agreement
with a non-profit or lease the house for a use compatible with the historic site, with revenues used to
support the exterior restoration of the building.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area is the last
major area of unspoiled green space near the heavily industrialized urban centers of northeast Ohio.
Cuyahoga Valley is biologically unique: a botanical crossroads between the central lowlands to the west
and the Appalachian Plateau to the east. The valley preserves numerous forested watersheds and open
grassy plateaus. There is relatively little development within the boundary of the recreation area.
Threat: With approximately five million people living within a one-hour drive of the recreation area, pressure
to develop previously undeveloped lands has increased. Highest priority is assigned to the acquisition of
undeveloped lands.
Need: The funds requested will be used to acquire a 418-acre undeveloped portion of the Blossom Music
Center, summer home of the world-renowned Cleveland Orchestra and a venue for pop concerts. The
Center property, owned by the Musical Arts Association in Cleveland, totals 780 acres, of which 583
acres are undeveloped and 197 acres are associated with the performance complex (amphitheater,
parking, visitor service facilities, support facilities, utility systems, etc.). The undeveloped portion is largely
natural forest land but does include two cell towers and 12 oil/gas wells. To date, the property, which is
zoned residential, has been managed in a manner generally compatible with the park. However, the
threat of a sale and development of this property would seriously impact the use of the property.
Public support for protecting this property from large-scale, residential development has been high.
Organizations who have expressed public support for NPS acquisition include the National Parks and
Conservation Association, the Western Reserve Land Conservancy and The Trust for Public Land (which
has been actively involved in the project). In addition, both major circulation newspapers in the area have
carried stories about the development threat and efforts to preserve the land. Both papers have published
editorials in strong support of Federal acquisition. The Cuyahoga Valley Regional Council of
Governments has also sent a letter in support of the acquisition; the Council represents the 15
communities (and associated school districts) in which the park lies.

There were three tracts to be acquired: the 1,840-acre Riverstone tract, the 2,395-acre Santee River tract and the 270-acre Johnston River tract.  Funds appropriated for FY 2005 were used to acquire the Santee River tract.  It is expected that acquisition of the 1,840-acre Riverstone property will cost approximately $5,880,000.  The Service completed acquisition of a 156-acre portion of the property for $500,000, leaving a balance of 1,674 acres to be acquired at an estimated cost of $5,380,000.  Funds available in FY 2009, $2.7 million, were obligated to acquire 837 acres, approximately half of those 1,674 
acres.  The FY 2010 request included $1,320,000 to acquire 410 acres, leaving 436 acres remaining to be acquired.
Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Acquisition of the Riverstone tract would connect
the two largest portions of the park together, protecting valuable wildlife migration corridors and providing
increased public access/safety across parklands.
Threat: There is significant interest in the subdivision and subsequent sale of this single large tract to
multiple parties. Meetings with local land trusts confirm the validity of specific interest in this tract for
subdivision. Such subdivision would greatly complicate future acquisition of resultant tracts. Logging and
residential development, resource poaching, and damaging recreational uses are the primary existing
threats to this forested land.
Need: The funds requested would be obligated to acquire a 436-acre tract, the final portion of the
Riverstone tract that was authorized for acquisition by Public Law 108-108 in 2003. The Riverstone tract
negotiations have taken place indirectly through an interested consortium of land trust/nonprofit
organizations, including The Trust for Public Land, the entity which has the property under contract.

the Virgin Islands containing outstanding natural and scenic resources of national significance.
Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: No other unit of the National Park System has the
combination of developing tropical forests and fine coral reefs that is found in Virgin Islands National Park.
Other resources requiring protection are the white sand beaches, certain endangered species, cactus
woodlands, and remnants of the cultural history of the Virgin Islands.
Threat: Privately owned tracts at the park are highly prized for recreational and commercial development
that would adversely impact the resources of the park.
Need: The requested funds will be obligated to complete the acquisition of Estate Maho Bay.
The Estate Maho Bay was originally a 419-acre property located on St. John’s Island within Virgin Islands
National Park. The ownership consisted of 11 undivided interests, three of which had been acquired by
the National Park Service. Following years of litigation and negotiations a partition was approved by the
court in 2007. Prior to the court partition, The Trust for Public Land (TPL) had acquired seven of the
remaining undivided interests. As the result of the court settlement the National Park Service received
114 acres as its share and approximately 98 acres will remain in private ownership with strict covenants
to prevent incompatible development. The remaining 207 acres are owned by TPL. TPL plans to make a
bargain sale of these lands to the National Park Service. While the value of the 207 acres that TPL holds
is estimated to be $18 million or more, they plan to make a phased sale of their holdings to the National
Park Service for only $9.5 million. The FY 2009 appropriation of $2,250,000 was obligated in April 2009 to
acquire a 26-acre portion of the TPL lands, leaving a balance of $7,250,000 needed to acquire the
remaining 181 acres. The FY 2010 appropriation included $2,250,000 to acquire a 91-acre portion of the
remainder. The present request for FY 2011, $3,750,000, will permit the acquisition of an additional 90
acres and thereby complete the Maho Bay acquisition.

Project Description: Providing a rugged backdrop to the gateway communities of Palm Springs, Palm Desert and La Quinta, the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument (NM) annually hosts over 1,500,000 visitors.  However, rapid urbanization, immediately adjacent to the Monument is threatening the tremendous scenic and wildlife resource values, which ironically helped to establish these resort communities in the early 1900’s.  A partnership effort including the State of California, BLM, U.S. Forest Service, local governments, and non-profit organizations has acquired more than 30,000 acres of inholdings to protect resources and improve management. 

Encompassing 272,000 acres, the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains NM is a series of steep escarpments, ranging from sea level to nearly 11,000 feet in elevation.  This undeveloped “island” is home to over 600 animal and plant species, residing within several distinct climatic zones.  Numerous threatened and endangered species, including one of the nation’s largest herds of Peninsular bighorn sheep, the least Bell’s vireo, populations of desert tortoise and desert slender salamander, and unique fan palm oases, are found among the area’s perennial streams, springs and seeps.  The Monument is within the Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan.

The Monument is co-administered by the BLM and U.S. Forest Service (64,400 acres of the Monument lie within the San Bernardino National Forest).  Three Wilderness units, the 94,989-acre Santa Rosa Mountain Wilderness, administered by BLM, and the 19,695-acre Santa Rosa Wilderness and a portion of the 33,177-acre San Jacinto Wilderness, administered by the U.S. Forest Service are imbedded within the Monument boundary.

Public Law 100-301 of April 29, 1988, established the Big Cypress National Preserve Addition to include 146,000 acres of land northeast of Big Cypress National Preserve and in a strip along the western boundary of the Preserve. Public Law 93-440, as amended by Public Law 100-301, provides that, if the State of Florida transfers to the Secretary lands within the addition, the Secretary shall pay to or reimburse the State (out of funds appropriated for such purpose) an amount equal to 80 percent of the total costs to the State of Florida of acquiring such lands.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The national preserve and addition protect the watershed for the threatened ecosystem of South Florida. Subtropical plant and animal life abounds in this area that is home to endangered species like the Florida panther and the red-cockaded woodpecker.

Threat: The expeditious acquisition of land is critical for the restoration of the South Florida ecosystem. Lands so acquired will improve water quality by providing a protective buffer between natural and urban areas, by allowing protection and restoration of habitat and wetlands, and by serving as water storage areas. Land acquisition must be completed if the natural water flows are to be restored.

Need: Laws governing the acquisition of lands for the national preserve require a shared acquisition responsibility with the State of Florida: an 80/20 percent, Federal/State split. The State of Florida has acquired 43,000 acres and conveyed approximately 29,000 of these acres to the United States in December, 2010. The NPS must now reimburse 80 percent of the cost for these lands as required by statue. The remaining acres are estimated to be ready for conveyance within the next 18 months. The funds requested, $5,560,000, will be obligated to cover the Federal share of the cost incurred by the State in acquiring the total 43,000 acres of land.

operational costs are expected to be incidental. Initial, non-recurring costs for the restoration and
reclamation are expected to about $955,000. About $740,000 would remove 37 camps, or about $20,000
per camp. An additional $255,000 would be needed to do restoration work such as fill removal from
wetlands, and restoring natural grade and hydrology in remote, road-less backcountry areas. However, with
this acquisition, pollution and exotic vegetation seed sources would be eliminated from non-Federal lands

Acquisition is necessary to eliminate threats to the natural hydrologic condition of the park, such as subdivisions and development of previously undeveloped tracts, incompatible construction or alterations of structures, dredge and fill operations, road construction, and the introduction of pollutants into surface or subsurface waters. The Corps of Engineers has started a restoration of the natural hydrologic system for the Everglades ecosystem. 

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The Act of December 13, 1989, authorized the construction of bridges along the Tamiami Trail to restore natural hydrologic conditions and improve ecological values. Currently a 1-mile bridge is under construction and is anticipated to be completed in late 2013. Restoring natural hydrologic conditions to Everglades NP will allow ecosystems to improve on their own, enhance the park’s biological diversity, and improve recreational and commercial opportunities throughout Florida and the Gulf region.

Threat: Over 107,000 acres have been acquired as part of the restoration project.  However six parcels of land (approximately 477 acres) located along the Tamiami Trail remain to be acquired. Deferring the acquisition of these parcels would serve to prevent realization of the benefits from the bridge construction. The US Army Corps of Engineers, overseeing the overall project, will not allow the water levels to increase until these properties are acquired. The nation’s largest environmental restoration project would be put on hold, and the mandate of Congress to restore the sheet flow to re-establish the park’s biological abundance and diversity would remain unrealized.

Project
Description
Taking its name from one of the longest living trees in the Arizona desert, the 129,000-
acre Ironwood Forest National Monument is a true Sonoran Desert showcase. The
Ironwood is a very long-lived tree, with some specimens estimated to be more than
800 years old. Ironwood is a keystone species because it provides a nursery
environment of shade and protection that enables young seedlings of other species to
become established despite the harsh desert climate, where night-time lows can
exceed 105°F. Studies by the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum have documented 560
plant species within the Monument. Resident birdwatchers have documented more
than 80 species of migratory and non-migratory birds. The Monument lies within the
scenic viewshed of the 1,210-mile Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail, which
skirts its eastern boundary.
The proposal involves the acquisition of two properties from highly-motivated willing
sellers. The parcels have been proposed for residential development, however a
reduced demand for residential units now provides an opportunity to eliminate this
potential threat.
The Cocoraque parcel is within the Cocoraque Butte Archeological District which was
listed on the National Register of Historic Places in October 1975. More than
200 Hohokam and Paleoindian archaeological sites dated between 600 and 1450
(including many petroglyphs) have been identified on this parcel and within the
Monument.
The Waterman parcel provides habitat to a small population of Nichol Turk’s Head
cactus, occurring in localized limestone-rich areas. The Nichol Turk’s Head is a very
slow-growing cactus, taking 10 years to reach a height of 2-3 inches. It was listed as
an endangered plant in 1976 and has an approved recovery plan."	 5,000 	 1,000

The act authorized the Secretary of the Interior to acquire such privately owned land from a willing seller, by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange. The Service’s FY 2012 budget request for the acquisition of such lands was not appropriated. 

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Petrified Forest National Park contains globally significant fossil from the Late Triassic Period. The park is a virtual laboratory offering opportunities for paleontological research and visitor understanding that are unparalleled. The conservation and protection of the fossil resources, especially petrified wood (critical park resource) is the reason for the original establishment of the park, while the protection of vast cultural resources (the secondary unit resource) is a major focus and the intent of later expansion legislation.

Threat: Direct threats to natural and cultural resources in the proposed expansion area include theft and vandalism of fragile and non-renewable archaeological and paleontological sites and resources. Although these occurrences are all within the parks congressionally approved administrative boundary, the park currently has no jurisdiction over these lands and therefore non-renewable paleontological and archaeological resources are unattended and subject to ongoing theft and vandalism.

Need: The requested funds will be used to acquire six tracts totaling 26,495 acres and comprising the Paulsell Ranch that is presently owned by the Hatch Family Limited Partnership. The ranch was added to the park in 2004 by P.L. 108-430 and is rich in archaeological and paleontological resources. The ranch contains several areas (e.g. Billings Gap) with globally significant paleontological resources that compliment those in the park and numerous historic cultural sites including rock art panels, as well as structures from the Puebloan period in the Southwest. This property also includes nine miles of the Puerco River Riparian area that provides crucial habitat for many of the species found in this area from insects and rodents to raptors and migrating elk. Federal acquisition of this property would result in greater, proactive resource protection and preservation of this significant landscape. Protective measures include vehicle, horse, and foot patrols by Law Enforcement Rangers, remote monitoring through the use of surveillance equipment, as well as site inventory and monitoring by resource management staff.

Project Description: The 250,000-acre Carrizo Plain National Monument, a majestic grassland preserve ringed by scenic mountain ridges, contains the last remaining undeveloped remnant of the San Joaquin Valley ecosystem.  It provides critical contiguous habitat for one of the largest assemblages of threatened and endangered species surviving on any public lands in the United States, including the blunt-nosed leopard lizard, San Joaquin kit fox, giant kangaroo rat, Kern primrose sphinx moth, longhorn fairy shrimp, vernal pool fairy shrimp, California jewelflower, San Joaquin wooly threads, and the San Joaquin antelope squirrel.  Within the vast expanse of the Carrizo Plain lies Painted Rock, an important ceremonial site of the Chumash people that rises majestically from the surrounding grassland.  In addition, the Monument contains other world-class archaeological sites, which are part of a current nomination as a National Historic Landmark.  Soda Lake, a glistening bed of white salt in the dry summer, and the largest alkali wetland remaining in Southern California, provides important habitat for migratory birds during the winter. Those interested in geology can view one of the most spectacular sections of the 800-mile long San Andreas Fault, with its complex corrugated topography, along the eastern edge of the Plain. 

The Monument’s diversity and proximity to over 20 million people living in Southern and Central California attracts over 75,000 visitors annually who come to enjoy a variety of recreational activities.  Those stopping at the Goodwin Education Center or taking guided tours to Painted Rock or the San Andreas Fault can share in the rich history of the Carrizo Plain and learn about its unique plant and animal life.

Subsequently the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act, Big Sur Wilderness and Conservation Act of 2002, Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Act of 2006, and most recently the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 designated 19 additional Wilderness areas on BLM lands in California.  These Wilderness areas stretch from the north coast of California to the peaks of the Sierra Nevada to lands along the Mexican border. 

Over 37 million people are now living in California.  These Wilderness areas offer places of solitude where people can experience freedom from our fast-paced industrialized society.  They are places where people can renew the human spirit through association with the natural world and offer a respite from the pressure of an ever increasing urban lifestyle.  These areas provide important habitat to a wide variety of animal and plant species, many threatened and endangered, and some Federally-listed species.  

Six Wilderness areas are transected by the 2,638-mile Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail and seven Wilderness areas are located adjacent to the Juan Bautista de Anza and Old Spanish National Historic Trails.

Project Description: Located along the entire 1,100-mile California coastline, the California Coastal National Monument comprises more than 20,000 small islands, rocks, exposed reefs, and pinnacles between Mexico and Oregon, covering approximately 1,000 acres of land.  The creation of the Monument ensures the protection of these features extending from mean high tide to within 12 nautical miles of the shoreline.

In an effort to meet the challenge of interpreting a predominately offshore Monument, the BLM seeks to establish a number of publically-accessible sites along the California coast where the resource and recreational values of the Monument can be better offered for public interpretation.  Many of these contact areas have been developed within areas currently managed by BLM, however the length of the California coast and population demographics indicate the need for additional sites dedicated to better interpret the Monument to the public.  In 2004 the BLM accepted donation of the neighboring 1,132-acre Stornetta parcel from The Nature Conservancy.  Now known as the Stornetta Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) the property includes 2.5 miles of coastline, abuts the historic Point Arena Lighthouse and shares a common boundary with 760-acre Manchester Beach State Park.

Acquisition of the Cypress Abbey parcel would link the Stornetta ACEC with the community of Point Arena, place two additional miles of coastline into public ownership and further completion of the California Coastal Trail.  The property contains critical habitat for two endangered species, the Behrens’ Silverspot Butterfly and the Point Arena subspecies of Mountain Beaver.  Both species are only found on this stretch of the California coast.  The Trust for Public Land has negotiated a leverage to fully cover the $8M cost of this property.

The Gunnison River is designated critical habitat for two threatened fish species.  Threatened plant species, and rare and diverse wildlife call the area home, including desert bighorn sheep, mule deer, golden eagle, mountain lion, black bear, and elk.  

The Massey parcel includes two miles of an alluvial bench along the Gunnison River.  This section of the Gunnison River is listed as critical habitat for two federally endangered fish species.  The parcel contains visible remnants of the Denver & Rio Grande Western railroad, a site of historical significance, as well as other riparian and scenic resource values.

The American Mountain Men parcel lies within Gibber Gulch, a magnificent, red-rock canyon.  The convergence of four major habitat types on the parcel, as well as the presence of naturally-occurring seeps and woodland riparian corridors, provides excellent wildlife habitat and potential habitat for rare plant communities.  Heritage resources on the property provide excellent opportunities for tourism, camping and self-guided interpretation.

1,000,000 acres. A total of 415 acres remain privately owned at the park. Four collaborating agencies
(NPS, FWS, BLM, and FS) are working to take advantage of opportunities to build resiliency in ecological
systems and communities. Building ecological resiliency includes maintaining intact, interconnected
landscapes, and restoring fragmented or degraded (but restorable) habitats. They have been working
with NGO partners (including The Nature Conservancy, The Conservation Fund, Trust for Public Land,
local land trusts), local community groups such as the Blackfoot Challenge & Rocky Mountain Front
Landowner Advisory Group and state & county government officials, to tailor the federal acquisition
program in a way to achieve synergy between private rights, open space, traditional land uses and
conservation. This shared vision includes maintaining working ranches and forests by acquiring
conservation easements as well as acquiring lands in fee that will provide public access and enjoyment.
Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Executing the planned acquisitions in all four
agencies can contribute to species conservation, such as, grizzly bears, wolverine, lynx, goshawk, willow
flycatcher, sage grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, burrowing owl, Lewis' woodpecker, trumpeter swan, yellowbilled
cuckoo, cutthroat trout, arctic grayling, and Columbia spotted frog. The federal projects complement
the conservation goals of Montana Comprehensive Fish and Wildlife Conservation Strategy (State
Wildlife Action Plan) as well as other conservation plans including the Montana Partners in Flight,
threatened and endangered species recovery plans (bull trout, grizzly bears, lynx, gray wolf), Forest
Management Plans and agency general management and Departmental level strategic plans (i.e., Great
Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative, etc.).
Funds are requested for eight tracts. They include the Harrison Creek Tract, a prime example of upland,
riparian and floodplain wildlife habitat; Cracker Lake tracts, in a glacial basin that is the third largest private
holding in the park and the only mining patents in the park; Big Prairie tracts, along the North Fork of the
Flathead in the major migration corridor for grizzly bear, wolf and ungulates; and the Cummings Meadow
tract, which is home to many T&E species and an intact riparian ecosystem, as well as the site of one of the
areas homesteads from the early 1900s.
Threat: If these tracts remain in private ownership, cabins and year-round housing may be developed,
floodplain manipulation or stream bank stabilization measures may be employed to decrease the impact
of natural flooding, migration corridors will be cut and displaced and ecosystems will be degraded. These
activities would jeopardize the natural resources, wilderness, and recreational values of the area.
Resource extraction, including logging or mining, is also likely on some of the properties. Large waterfront
parcels of private property are highly desirable and lack or difficulty of access has proven not to be a
deterrent to purchase and development. Parcels in areas within easy reach of existing infrastructure are
prime for development allowing further displacement of species, and riparian areas are desirable for
human use and development.
National Park Service FY 2013 Budget Justifications
LASA-16
Need: The funds are needed to acquire eight parcels, totaling 318 acres located in the park along the
North Fork and Middle Fork of the Flathead River about one mile upstream from the confluence with
Harrison Creek and in the Cummings Meadow area. These tracts have very high resource value as
upland, riparian, and floodplain landscapes and habitat. Some of the tracts are surrounded by the park’s
recommended wilderness area and are candidates for eventual addition to the wilderness system.
Development of the land would jeopardize wilderness resource values as well as the backcountry
character of the surrounding land."	 -   	 -

Project Description: The Blackfoot River watershed is celebrated nationally and treasured locally for its outstanding values – legendary fishing and floating, threatened and endangered species and big game habitat, unspoiled natural beauty and a rural lifestyle symbolic of values vanishing in the West.  The Blackfoot River watershed occupies a critical location in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, serving as the southern “bookend” for the Yellowstone to Yukon (Y2Y) Conservation Initiative.  The watershed serves as a buffer and linkage zone for wildlife moving in and out of the Bob Marshall/ Scapegoat Wilderness Complex, along the Continental Divide and between the Clark Fork River drainage and the Garnet Range.

The Blackfoot system possesses exceptional wetlands, riparian, grasslands, and forestland vegetation associations.  These ecosystems possess exceptional biodiversity and high scenic value.  An active partnership with the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks is working to restore Bull trout (T&E listed species) habitat.  Traversing the breadth of Montana, the Lewis and Clark NHT Trail crosses lands with some of the richest resources and diversity in the region.  In July 1806 Captain Meriwether Lewis and nine members of the Corps of Discovery followed this course of the Blackfoot River on the return leg of their expedition. 

The proposed acquisition, supported by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks is a component of The Nature Conservancy’s broader Montana Legacy Project and is the final TNC-BLM acquisition in the project area.

of the remaining tallgrass prairie in the eastern Dakotas, including 25,000 acres in North Dakota and
165,000 acres in South Dakota. These easement acquisitions will help to maintain traditional ranching
operations while fostering landscape-level conservation.
The project area has a rich variety of plant, animal, and insect species including more than 147 species of
breeding birds ranging from neotropical migrants to waterfowl. Several candidate endangered species are
found within the tallgrass prairie ecosystem, including Baird’s sparrow, loggerhead shrike, ferruginous
hawk, and rare butterflies such as the Dakota skipper. The endangered western prairie fringed orchid also
occurs in the tallgrass prairie. These large blocks of grasslands help to buffer prairie ecosystems from
agricultural chemicals and invasive species, and provide the natural habitat mosaic required by prairie dependent

The Act of October 5, 2004 (P.L. 108-312), revised the boundary of Mount Rainier National Park and authorized the acquisition of: (1) up to 800 acres of land near the Carbon River entrance in the northwest corner of the park, and (2) up to one acre in the vicinity of Wilkeson, Washington, for a facility to serve visitors to public lands along the Carbon and Mowich Corridors.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal:  The park includes Mount Rainier (14,410'), an active volcano encased in over 35 square miles of snow and ice. The park contains outstanding examples of old growth forests and alpine meadows. The park was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1997 as a showcase for the ""NPS Rustic"" style architecture of the 1920s and 1930s. The Carbon River area of Mount Rainier National Park is located in the park’s northwest corner, situated closest to the highest growth counties (King and Pierce) of the Puget Sound Metropolitan area. The area provides access to popular trailheads which lead to the Carbon Glacier, lowest glacier in the contiguous United States.  Mount Rainier’s glacial system (35 square miles), as a whole, is the most extensive system in the contiguous United States. The area also includes one of the last remnant inland, old-growth rainforests which is prime habitat for the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, and bull trout.

Threat:  The Carbon River area of Mount Rainier National Park is accessed by a primitive two-lane gravel road which serves the 29-site Ipsut Creek automobile campground, picnic area, and 36 site day-use parking area/trailhead for access to the popular Carbon Glacier and Wonderland Trail. The road, having been built either within or very close to the Carbon River floodplain, and  the  campground and portions of the trail leading out of the developed area have received severe flood damage over the years.

Approximately 1,366 acres of these school trust lands were subsequently included within the boundaries of Grand Teton National Park when the park was established in 1950. In addition, the State of Wyoming also holds title to 40 acres of subsurface mineral rights within the park. Because of their location within the park, the State has not been obtaining maximum revenue from the lands, as required by its constitution. The Grand Teton National Park Land Exchange Act (P.L. 108-32, June 17, 2003) authorizes Federal acquisition of the school lands by any one of a combination of (1) donation, (2) purchase, or (3) exchange whereby the State would receive lands of equal value from the Bureau of Land Management, provided that those lands are located in the State of Wyoming and had previously been identified for disposal.  Additionally, lands at the park entrance along the Snake River are owned by a family who has worked with NPS for years to transfer the lands into Federal ownership and preserve the river frontage and meadow lands wildlife habitat.  These lands serve as a buffer between Jackson Hole Mountain Resort and the park lands.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The NPS mission at the park is to protect and preserve the Teton Range, its surrounding landscapes, ecosystems, cultural and historical resources. The tracts are located in highly visible, scenic wildlife-rich areas of the park.  They contain wildlife migration corridors used for both summer and winter grazing. Development of this land in the park would have significant impacts and consequences, irreparably affecting water quality, vegetation, wildlife habitat, and the visual integrity of the entire park.  These acquisitions will contribute to species conservation, such as, grizzly bears, wolverine, lynx, goshawk, willow flycatcher, sage grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, burrowing owl, Lewis’ woodpecker, trumpeter swan, yellow-billed cuckoo, cutthroat trout, arctic grayling, and Columbia spotted frog. A number of large game species, such as antelope, elk, deer, and moose, range throughout the acquisition area and can be hunted within fee ownership acquisitions (excepting NPS lands). This acquisition complements the conservation goals of state wildlife action plans as well as other conservation plans like partners in flight, endangered species recovery plans, forest management plans and agency general management and departmental level strategic plans, etc.

Threat: The development of these lands into further resort housing, or by individuals for trophy homes will destroy the integrity of the open space, the wildlife habitat and the migration corridors of the landscape.  

Need: The State of Wyoming entered into an agreement with the United States for a phased conveyance, to be completed by January 5, 2015, of approximately 1,400 acres of State-owned land within Grand Teton National Park for the appraised value of $107 million, subject to the availability of necessary funds. Phase 1, conveyance by the State of mineral rights in 39.59 acres, will be completed with funds available in fiscal year 2011. Phase 2, Federal acquisition of the 86.32-acre Snake River tract for $16,000,000, must be completed by January 5, 2013, with $1,000,000 of funds in this request. The additional funds in this request ($15,000,000) will permit the acquisition of a 35-acre tract in the Snake River valley along the Moose-Wilson Road entrance to the park.  "	 -   	 -

Project Description:  Located along the entire 1,100-mile California coastline, the California Coastal National Monument (NM) comprises more than 20,000 small islands, rocks, exposed reefs, and pinnacles between Mexico and Oregon, covering approximately 1,000 acres of land.  The creation of the Monument ensures the protection of these features extending from mean high tide to within 12 nautical miles of the shoreline.

In an effort to meet the challenge of interpreting a predominately offshore Monument, the BLM seeks to establish a number of publically-accessible sites along the California coast where the resource and recreational values of the Monument can be better offered for public interpretation.  Many of these contact areas have been developed within areas currently managed by BLM, however the length of the California coast and population demographics indicate the need for additional sites dedicated to better interpret the Monument to the public.  In 2004 the BLM accepted donation of the neighboring 1,132-acre Stornetta parcel from The Nature Conservancy.  Now known as the Stornetta Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) the property includes 2.5 miles of coastline, abuts the historic Point Arena Lighthouse and shares a common boundary with the 760-acre Manchester State Park.

The BLM completed acquisition of the Cypress Abbey (Phase I) parcel in January 2012 with a $2M leverage from the California Coastal Conservancy.  Funding for Phase II of Cypress Abbey parcel was requested in the FY2013 President’s Budget.  This request would provide funding for two small coastal inholdings and complete the Point Arena purchase.  The property contains critical habitat for two endangered species, the Behrens’ Silverspot Butterfly and the Point Arena subspecies of Mountain Beaver.  Both species are only found on this stretch of the California coast.

Project Description: There are 88 designated Wilderness areas encompassing over 3.9 million acres of public land in California.  The first 69 Wilderness areas were designated in southern California with the passage of the California Desert Protection Act of 1994. Subsequently the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act of 1999, Big Sur Wilderness and Conservation Act of 2002, Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Act of 2006, and most recently the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 designated 19 additional Wilderness areas on BLM lands in California.  These Wilderness areas stretch from the north coast of California to the peaks of the Sierra Nevada to lands along the Mexican border. 

Over 37 million people live in California.  These Wilderness areas offer places of solitude where people can experience freedom from our fast-paced industrialized society.  They are places where people can renew the human spirit through association with the natural world and offer a respite from the pressure of an ever increasing urban lifestyle. 

These Wilderness areas also provide important habitat to a wide variety of animal and plant species, many threatened and endangered, and some Federally-listed species.  There are six Wilderness areas that are transected by the 2,638-mile Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, as well as seven Wilderness areas that are located adjacent to the Juan Bautista de Anza and Old Spanish National Historic Trails.

Project Description Providing a rugged backdrop to the gateway communities of Palm Springs, Palm Desert and La Quinta, the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument hosted approximately 1,500,000 visitors in 2008.  Ironically, rapid urbanization, immediately adjacent to the Monument is threatening the tremendous scenic and wildlife resource values, which helped to establish these resort communities in the early 1900’s.

Encompassing 272,000 acres, the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains NM is a series of steep escarpments, ranging from sea level to nearly 11,000 feet in elevation.  This undeveloped “island” is home to over 600 animal and plant species, residing within several distinct climatic zones.  Numerous threatened and endangered species, including one of the nation’s largest herds of Peninsular bighorn sheep, the least Bell’s vireo, populations of desert tortoise and desert slender salamander, and unique fan palm oases, are found among the area’s perennial streams, springs and seeps.  The Monument is within the Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan.

The Monument is co-administered by the BLM and U.S. Forest Service (64,400 acres of the Monument lie within the San Bernardino National Forest).  Three Wilderness areas, the 94,989-acre Santa Rosa Mountain Wilderness, administered by BLM, and the 19,695-acre Santa Rosa Wilderness and a portion of the 33,177-acre San Jacinto Wilderness, administered by the Forest Service are imbedded within the Monument boundary.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The California Desert Southwest Focal Area is
comprised of Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and Imperial Counties located in Southern California.
The area features extensive wildlife corridors, miles of national trails, and 72 federally protected species.
Southern California contains two distinct deserts: the Sonoran Desert and the Mojave Desert. The Mojave
Desert occupies more than 25,000 square miles and receives less than six inches of rain per year. Plant
and animal life varies by elevation. Desert tortoises burrow in creosote bush flats, while the black and
yellow Scott’s oriole nests in Joshua trees higher up the slopes. Mule deer and bighorn sheep roam
among pinyon pine and juniper in the park’s many mountain ranges. Perennial vegetation is composed
mostly of low shrubs. To preserve and protect the desert wildlands of Southern California, the California
Desert Protection Act of 1994 established Mojave National Preserve as a unit of the National Park System
and revised the boundaries and designations of Death Valley National Park and Joshua Tree National Park
Threat: In the Mojave Desert, the wilderness portions of NPS units are threatened by growing residential
and commercial development and by increased use of recreational vehicles that damage the fragile
desert resources.
Need: The requested funds totaling $7,595,000 are needed to acquire 3,381.13 acres in Joshua Tree

Acquisition would also help to preserve a tapestry of federal, state, and private forest lands that provide more than a million acres of unfragmented habitat for a variety of federally-listed endangered and threatened species, including red-cockaded woodpecker, wood stork, flatwoods salamander, Eastern indigo snake, and whooping crane. Residential, commercial, and industrial, fragmentation, extraction industries, loss of public access, and loss of paleontological resources are some the greatest threats facing this landscape.  Acquisition funding would significantly contribute to a multi-partner, multi-state effort to ensure resiliency and connectivity of this ecosystem, support working lands, enhance recreational access and opportunities, and protect historic and cultural resources.

Lakeshore to protect and preserve outstanding natural resources along the mainland shore of Lake
Michigan and on certain nearby islands in Benzie and Leelanau Counties, Michigan.
Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The national lakeshore is a diverse landscape with
massive sand dunes, quiet rivers, sand beaches, beech-maple forests, clear lakes, and rugged bluffs
towering as high as 460 feet above Lake Michigan. Two offshore wilderness islands offer tranquility and
seclusion.
Threat: Congress recognized the importance of the natural features of the Sleeping Bear Dunes area of
Michigan in establishing the National Lakeshore in 1970. Acquisition is necessary to minimize or eliminate
the impact of constant threats, disturbances, past land use practices, increasing use and special
interests, and pressures of outside growth and development.
Need: The funds would be used to acquire, from willing sellers, fee interest in five tracts totaling 36.75
acres needed to prevent development that would adversely impact the national lakeshore. Three of the
tracts are improved with small homes, two of which are on the waterfront. It has been a recent practice of
landowners in the area to raze such homes and replace them with larger trophy homes complete with
swimming beach, patio, and boathouse. The remaining two tracts are undeveloped wooded land.
Acquisition is necessary to prevent development that would impair landscape continuity and to provide
visitor use and enjoyment of the waterfront."	 -   	 -

Project Description: The Blackfoot River watershed is celebrated nationally and treasured locally for its outstanding values – legendary fishing and floating, threatened and endangered species and big game habitat, unspoiled natural beauty and a rural lifestyle symbolic of values vanishing in the West.  The Blackfoot River watershed occupies a critical location in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, serving as the southern “bookend” for the Yellowstone to Yukon (Y2Y) Conservation Initiative.  The watershed serves as a buffer and linkage zone for wildlife moving in and out of the Bob Marshall/ Scapegoat Wilderness Complex, along the Continental Divide and between the Clark Fork River drainage and the Garnet Range.

As a part of the larger Crown of the Continent ecosystem the Blackfoot watershed system possesses exceptional wetlands, riparian, grasslands, and forestland vegetation associations.  These ecosystems possess exceptional biodiversity and high scenic value.  The proposed acquisition supports community-based conservation efforts to build resiliency in these ecosystems.  Building ecological resiliency includes maintaining intact, interconnected landscapes, and restoring fragmented or degraded (but restorable) habitats.  The parcel contains occupied grizzly bear (threatened) habitat and Canada lynx (threatened) designated critical habitat as well as fisheries habitat for westslope cutthroat trout (sensitive).

The proposed acquisition, supported by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks is a component of Blackfoot Challenge and The Nature Conservancy’s broader Blackfoot Community Project.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Southeast longleaf pine savanna ranging from North
Carolina to Texas is one of three major hotspots of biodiversity east of the Mississippi River. Many
threatened and endangered species require a longleaf pine ecosystem to survive, the endangered redcockaded
woodpecker being the keystone species for the ecosystem. In establishing the Department of the
Interior America’s Great Outdoors Program, Secretary’s Order No. 3323 of September 12, 2012, designated
Longleaf Pine Landscape Conservation as a Landscape of National Significance. Among the federal
conservation units included in this ecosystem are Congaree National Park in South Carolina and Timucuan
Ecological and Historic Preserve in Florida.
Threat: Longleaf pines which once covered 98 million acres in the Southeastern United States have been
reduced to approximately three million acres, much of it in poor condition.
Need: The requested target level of $3,459,000 is needed to acquire, from willing sellers, seven tracts

Threat: Developments and other land uses adjacent to the boundary threaten the integrity of the park's resources, views, and wilderness values. Surrounding land use has changed significantly since the original designation of the site as a national monument in 1936. Subdivisions, utility corridors, interstate and state highways, mining, military facilities, landfills, and agricultural interests are near or, in some cases, right along the boundary.

Need: The funds are needed to acquire, from Mojave Desert Land Trust (MDLT), 201.45 acres of land at the park. These tracts were acquired by MDLT with grants from the Resources Legacy Fund, a public charity with a mission to advance the conservation of natural resources. These undeveloped tracts are located at the southeastern quadrant area of the park within or adjacent to a designated wilderness area. Costs related to land stewardship and holding expenses are causing a significant strain on the MDLT budget. Federal acquisition of these tracts from MDLT will ensure the preservation of this wilderness area and provide MDLT with the funds necessary to pursue additional acquisitions at the park."	 -   	 -

Building ecological resiliency includes maintaining intact, interconnected landscapes, and restoring fragmented or degraded (but restorable) habitats. The Act of October 31, 1994, established Mojave National Preserve and authorized acquisition by donation, purchase, or exchange. As of December 31, 2013, the preserve contains a total of 1,540,653 acres.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Mojave National Preserve is an expanse of desert lands representing three of the four major North American deserts: the Mojave, Great Basin and Sonoran. Dozens of seeps and springs coupled with varied elevations and soil types create microhabitats that support a diversity of plant and animal life. The preserve protects the fragile habitat of the desert tortoise, vast open spaces, and historic mining scenes such as the Kelso railroad depot. 

Threat: Unchecked development threatens the significant natural, scenic, and archeological resources in the core of the preserve and along the southern and eastern gateways.

Need: The requested funds are needed to acquire 1,861.66 acres at Mojave National Preserve. Much of this land is located within or adjacent to wilderness areas and has been acquired by The Mojave Desert Land Trust (MDLT) for eventual conveyance to the United States, subject to the availability of federal acquisition funds. MDLT is a small land trust and the costs to hold and maintain these lands are a significant drain on the MDLT budget. Failure to acquire these tracts from MDLT will threaten this partnership effort which has successfully protected many tracts of land at Mojave National Preserve."	 -   	 -

Additionally, the Act authorized the acquisition of lands and interests in land bordering both sides of Highway 101 between the southern boundary of Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park and a point on Redwood Creek near the town of Orick to a depth sufficient to maintain or to restore a screen of trees between the highway and the land behind the screen.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Redwood National Park is home to some of the world's tallest trees: old-growth coast redwoods. They can live to be 2,000 years old and grow to over 300 feet tall. The park's mosaic of habitats includes prairie/ oak woodlands, mighty rivers and streams, and 37 miles of pristine Pacific coastline. The north-south mostly two-lane US Highway 101 is the main road through the park, winding its way through forested hills and along the rugged coastline. Nonfederal Prairie Creek Corridor parcels lie on both sides of Highway 101 at the southern gateway to the park. These lands parallel Prairie Creek for 2 miles, from Lost Man Creek to the junction with Redwood Creek. They provide important migration corridors for Roosevelt elk, old-growth habitat for marbled murrelets and northern spotted owls, and contain substantial sections of Prairie Creek, a fish-bearing stream that supports coho and chinook salmon and steelhead and cutthroat trout. Acquisition of these parcels would preserve such resources, while improving the scenic quality of the southern gateway to the park. 

Threat: Because of the parcels' immediate proximity to US Highway 101, there is significant potential for commercial development and subsequent resource damage and habitat degradation. 

Need: The requested funds will be used to acquire 14 Prairie Creek Corridor tracts totaling 198.16 acres that lie on both sides of Highway 101 at the southern gateway to the park. Acquisition of these parcels would improve the quality of the scenic entrance corridor to the park, and provide recreational opportunities including access to Trillium Falls, Berry Glen, and Davison Trails. Save the Redwoods League, a nonprofit conservation organization, is actively working with the Service to acquire these tracts."	 -   	 -

Project Description: The 173,000-acre Canyons of the Ancients National Monument was established in 2000 to protect cultural and natural resources on a landscape scale. The remarkable cultural resources here have been a focal point of explorers and researchers for 130 years. The Monument contains the highest density of cultural resource sites in the nation with more than 100 sites/square mile; 6,000 sites are documented and a total of 20,000-30,000 are predicted. Site types include cliff dwellings, villages, great kivas, shrines, agricultural fields, check dams, petroglyphs and pictographs and pottery kilns. Many sites have standing walls. Eight sites and one District (including 167 sites), are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Lowry Pueblo is a National Historic Landmark. Native Americans maintain close ties to the landscape and to the sites occupied by their ancestors. The BLM staff regularly involves tribal consultants in interpretation and education projects. Canyons of the Ancients offers an unparalleled opportunity to observe, study, and experience how cultures lived and adapted over time in the American Southwest.

Monument resources include spectacular land forms with deeply incised canyons, sheer sandstone cliffs, and panoramic vistas; riparian areas with habitat for the threatened and endangered Southwestern Willow flycatcher and unique herpetological species such as the Longnose Leopard lizard and the Desert Spiny lizard, both on the State Director’s Sensitive Species List. Wildlife includes deer, elk, mountain lion, bear, coyote, fox, wild turkey, falcons and eagles. The Monument includes three Wilderness Study Areas and surrounds three units of Hovenweep National Monument, managed by the National Park Service. Approximately 45,000 annual visitors take advantage of opportunities for visiting cultural resource sites, camping, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and ATVs (on existing roads), hunting, and wildlife viewing."	 10,000 	 2,000 	Also includes edgeholdings.

Project Description: Funds would be used to acquire fee title to approximately 779 acres in seven Refuge divisions located within the Connecticut River watershed. Acquisition of approximately 40 acres within the Refuge’s Fort River Division (MA) would benefit a large grassland project for grassland species, the endangered dwarf wedge mussel, and anadromous fish. The Service would also acquire 159 acres of riparian habitat within the Westfield River Division (MA). Acquisition of 529 acres of northern boreal forest will include 164 acres in the Nulhegan Basin Division (VT) and 365 acres in the Pondicherry and Mohawk River Divisions (NH), and will protect nesting songbird habitat and provide public opportunities for wildlife-dependent recreation. The Service would acquire 51 total acres in the Refuge’s Whalebone Cove and Salmon River Divisions (CT), which contain extensive freshwater tidal marshes used by migrating and wintering waterfowl. 

Acquisition of these tracts, in partnership with others, would enhance connectivity across area, elevation, latitude, aspect, and process within the 1.8 million acre Connecticut River watershed. Improving connectivity across the landscape would better position waterfowl (27 species), other migratory birds (247 species), and threatened and endangered species (9 species) for anticipated changes resulting from climate change, providing potential opportunities for species emigration and adaptation as habitats change in temperature, precipitation, and water levels. Connecting lands under Refuge stewardship within an extensive and expanding conservation mosaic would also promote representation, redundancy, and resiliency within the watershed. These project features provide a robust foundation for nationally significant and vital wildlife habitat that will sustain high quality opportunities for wildlife-dependent outdoor recreation for current and future generations of Americans. Each of the proposed acquisitions makes clear and valuable contributions to each of the six legislated purposes for the Refuge while strategically integrating Service investments into the larger landscape."	 -   	 -

The trail passes through four National Park System units: Pu’ukohola Heiau National Historic Site, Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park, Pu’uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park, and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. 

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail is a 175-mile coastal trail corridor that traverses all of Hawai'i Island's western half and most of its southern coast. The trail connects shoreline sites associated with Polynesian settlement, illustrating how Hawaiians flourished as a civilization. Events commemorated along the trail include Captain Cook’s historic landing, the rise of Kamehameha I, and changes leading to Hawai’i’s unique blend of cultures. 

Threat: Development of the subject property may permanently destroy significant cultural and natural resources, as well as the view sheds from the land and ocean. The proposed acquisition will conserve a half-mile of undeveloped and scenic coastline. 

Need: Combined with $1.5 million made available in FY 2013, it is expected that the requested funds would permit the acquisition of a 59-acre undeveloped tract that contains numerous important cultural and natural resources associated with the region. The natural resources include, but are not limited to, at least four threatened and endangered species. The tract is part of a larger subdivision where large residential estates have already been built or are in the process of being built. The owner must liquidate land assets in the near future.

Project Description: Born of snowmelt and springs among high ridges of Yellowstone country, the 42,900-acre Upper Snake/South Fork Snake River project is an area like no other in the West. Gliding through mountains, canyons, and meadows, and the vast farmlands of the Snake River plains; a 1980 USFWS evaluation rated this area the most valuable, biodiverse, and unique ecosystem in Idaho. It is considered Idaho's #1 Priority Wetland based on resource values and threats to the river (Idaho Parks & Recreation report). The riparian corridor, lined with commanding cottonwood galleries and a lush shrub understory, sustains a broad variety of plants, fish, birds, and wildlife populations. It is the only home for the federally-threatened Ute ladies’-tresses orchid in Idaho, is a world famous, blue ribbon fishery, supporting the largest wild Yellowstone cutthroat trout population outside of Yellowstone National Park, and provides multiple wildlife migration corridors and habitat connectivity including habitat for the expanding Yellowstone National Park grizzly bear population, a Federally threatened species. The area provides crucial habitat for 126 bird species, including the majority of Idaho’s bald eagle production and has been designated as a Nationally Important Bird Area.

The first World Fly Fishing Championship in North America took place on the South Fork in 1997. Diverse water based recreational opportunities account for 337,000 recreational visits per year. According to a recent economic report fishing and boating within the project area supports 350 jobs and generates $12 million in income. The scope of the project increased dramatically as a result of enormous public support and the residual impact from the 1997 100-year flood event.

Project Description: The Nez Perce National Historic Trail (NHT) follows the same journey undertaken by a band of the Nez Perce Indian tribe in 1877 during their attempt to flee the U.S. Cavalry. The 1,170 mile trail was created in 1986 as part of the National Trails System Act and is managed by USFS. The trail traverses through portions of Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Wyoming and connects 38 separate sites across these 4 states that commemorate significant events which occurred to the Nez Perce during their attempt to escape capture by the U.S. Cavalry who were under orders to move the Indians onto a reservation. There is no visible trace of the Nez Perce NHT remaining on the Diamond D Ranch; however, an intensive inventory has not been conducted to locate trail segments, or associated sites or features related to their 1877 flight. Currently, U.S. Highway 20 follows the trail corridor through this area.

On the western doorstep of Yellowstone National Park and surrounded by the Continental Divide, the 35,875-acre Henrys Lake Area of Critical Environmental Concern’s exceptional aesthetic and wildlife values have been an attraction to generations of Americans who have fished, hiked, hunted, skied and snowmobiled here. The area offers high quality open space, rangeland, streams, wetlands, and wildlife and fish resources to the approximately 4,000,000 annual visitors who pass through the area. Antelope, elk, moose, and mule deer utilize the region for summer/winter range and as a migratory corridor connecting summer range in Yellowstone National Park with winter range in Idaho and Montana. The world-renowned Henrys Lake fishery is the last stronghold in the Henrys Fork basin for the Yellowstone cutthroat trout. Working ranches in the area provide valuable summer range for cattle operations based throughout Idaho, contributing an important economic base for ranching families.

The Act of October 30, 2004 (P.L. 108-394), revised the boundary to include approximately 615 acres of additional lands and authorized the acquisition of such lands and associated personal property by donation, by purchase from willing sellers with donated or appropriated funds, or by exchange. The commemoration of the Civil War Sesquicentennial finishes in 2015.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The battle fought here on August 10, 1861, was the first major Civil War engagement west of the Mississippi River, involving about 5,400 Union troops and 12,000 Confederates. Although a Confederate victory, the Southerners failed to capitalize on their success. The battle led to greater federal military activity in Missouri, and set the stage for the Battle of Pea Ridge in March 1862. Wilson's Creek was also the scene of the death of Nathaniel Lyon, the first Union general to be killed in combat. With the exception of the vegetation, the 2,368-acre national battlefield has changed little from its historic setting, enabling the visitor to experience the battlefield in near pristine condition.

Threat: Because of imminent threats of development, the Wilson's Creek National Battlefield Foundation purchased the property to prevent developers from constructing homes upon the land. 

Need: The funds will be used to acquire properties of National significance, related to the park's primary purpose to preserve the area encompassed by the Battle of Wilson's Creek. A 63-acre area ownership (two tracts) includes the rallying point for Louisiana and Arkansas forces that had retreated from the Ray cornfield after nearly overwhelming advancing Union infantry in the opening stages of the battle. Acquisition of the property would extend the park-managed boundary to the ridge line at the eastern edge of the park, thus preventing housing from being erected directly behind the Ray House.

The Civil War Battle of Glorieta Pass was a decisive battle that resulted in the collapse of the Confederacy’s plan to capture the riches and support of the West, thus largely ending the Civil War in the West. The commemoration of the Civil War Sesquicentennial finishes in 2015. Of the lands added to the park, 49 acres were public lands and 629 acres were privately owned. Of the privately owned lands, 292 acres remain to be acquired. 

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The park preserves 12,000 years of human history, including the remains of Pecos Pueblo and many other American Indian structures, Spanish colonial missions, homesteads of the Mexican era, a section of the Santa Fe Trail, sites related to the Civil War Battle of Glorieta Pass, and a 20th-century ranch. Threat: The park is threatened by increased development activity in the area due to the growing popularity of the region. The park is located only 25 miles southeast of Santa Fe. 

Need: The requested funds will be obligated to acquire three undeveloped tracts totaling 47 acres located in the Cañoncito section of the park’s Glorieta Unit where Union forces destroyed the Confederate supply camp. Several Confederate wagons were captured and burned on these tracts. Two of the tracts have been subdivided into 22 lots for development of private residences. The third tract is under pressure to be converted to heavy agricultural use. Currently the Cañoncito section of the park is undeveloped and not accessible to the public and will remain so until these tracts are acquired. The tracts are easily accessible from Interstate Highway 25 and would provide access necessary to attract visitors and allow auto-tours of the section."	 -   	 10,000

Project Description: The John Day River (JDR) is the third longest free-flowing river in the contiguous U.S. In 1988, Congress designated 147 of its 281 miles as the John Day National Wild and Scenic River (JDNWSR). The 6,382-acre Spring Basin Wilderness was created in March 2009 and is bordered by the JDNWSR. The wilderness comprises rugged cliffs, remote canyons and colorful geologic features. Common wildlife species in the area include mule deer, golden eagle, prairie falcon, bobcat, mountain bluebird and meadowlark.

The JDR is the Columbia Basin's most biologically diverse river system with the largest native fish populations in Oregon, including Chinook salmon, Mid-Columbia Steelhead and Bull Trout; both listed as Threatened. The system includes the mainstem and its North, Middle and South Forks and covers more than 500 river miles. The JDR and its tributaries have been identified as a salmon stronghold and key for recovery of important fish populations. The landscape also provides enhanced opportunities for bats, neo-tropical and resident birds and dispersal territories for wide-ranging species like elk, mule deer and wolverine.

The project area has several congressional and administrative designations including: the newly designated Spring Basin Wilderness, seven Wilderness Study Areas, the John Day and South Fork JDNWSR, State Scenic Waterways, State Wildlife Management Areas along the lower mainstem and along the South Fork and the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument (managed by the National Park Service).

Purchase Opportunities: Three parcels are available from highly-motivated willing sellers. The parcels are threatened with rural residential development and use which would be incompatible with the Trail.

Project Description: From scorching desert valleys in Southern California to rain forests in the Pacific Northwest, the 2,663-mile long Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail (NST) offers hikers and equestrians a unique, varied experience from Mexico to Canada through 3 western states. It reveals the beauty of the desert, unfolds the glaciated expanses of the Sierra Nevada, and provides commanding vistas of volcanic peaks and glaciers in the Cascade Range. The trail also passes through historic mining sites and evidence of man’s endless quest for natural resources.

The Pacific Crest NST was congressionally designated a National Scenic Trail in 1968. Thousands of hikers and equestrians enjoy this national treasure each year. Some only travel a few miles, while others complete every mile in a single season. About 300 hikers attempt to cover the full length of the Pacific Crest NST each year.

The BLM-managed portion of the Pacific Crest NST crosses approximately 50 parcels of private property in Oregon, totaling over 7,700 acres.

The Act of August 17, 1990, revised the boundary and authorized the appropriation of such funds as necessary for land acquisition at Gettysburg National Military Park. The act added 1,791 acres of privately owned land to the park. 

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The great Civil War battle fought here July 1-3, 1863, repulsed the second Confederate invasion of the North. Gettysburg National Cemetery -- more than 7,000 interments, 1,668 unidentified -- adjoins the park. At the dedication of the cemetery on November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered his timeless Gettysburg Address. 

Threat: There is intense pressure to commercially develop privately owned lands in and around Gettysburg National Military Park. Such development would threaten the historic integrity of the park. Need: One tract contains the remains of McAllister's Mill, the only documented Underground Railroad site within the Park boundary. The tract was the site of the Civil War-era James McAllister farm and grist mill and was central to local efforts related to the Underground Railroad. The McAllister family had been active in the abolitionist and underground railroad movement since its inception in Adams County in the first half of the nineteenth century. The buildings, primarily the grist mill, were used as stations on that railroad in which fugitive slaves were sheltered on their way to New York and Canada. The site contained many landscape features and structures that affected the outcome of the battle or were used for field hospitals. These included the stone dams that provided water power for the grist mill but had a far more reaching effect in backing up and deepening the water of Rock Creek thereby slowing the crossing of Confederate infantry in its attempt to carry Culp's Hill on the night of July 2, 1863. The acquisition of this tract will preserve the remaining foundations of the McAllister Buildings, as well as landscape features. Three other tracts will be acquired in the key areas of the battlefield with the help of the Civil War Preservation Trust."	 -   	 -

The act revised the 1974 administrative boundary in accordance with the recommendations of the park's general management plan. The Act of October 27, 1992, revised the boundary to include an additional 560 acres. Section 344 of Public Law 105-83, the act making appropriations for the Department of the Interior for fiscal year 1998, stated the sense of the Senate that “…Congress should give special priority to the preservation of Civil War battlefields by making funds available for the purchase of threatened and endangered Civil War battlefield sites.” The commemoration of the Civil War Sesquicentennial finishes in 2015.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The park contains portions of four major Civil War battlefields, Chatham Manor, Salem Church, and the historic building in which Stonewall Jackson died. 

Threat: Due to its proximity to Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia, the park is subject to intense pressure for commercial and residential development.

Need: The requested funds are needed to acquire two tracts containing approximately 80 acres. One tract is undeveloped forested land located in the Core Area of the Chancellorsville Battlefield (as defined by the 1993 Civil War Sites Commission) along Route 3 in Spotsylvania County. The tract is at the heart of the 380-acre Jackson Flank Attack zone at Chancellorsville with frontage on Route 3 opposite a major intersection (part of which is zoned commercial). The other tract is in the Core Area of the Wilderness Battlefield along Route 20 in Orange County, VA, and still in a relatively natural state. This is an area of the park under heavy development pressure as exemplified by the recent controversy over a Super Walmart that was planned for the intersection of Routes 3 & 20.

As they pass through or alongside NWRs, they protect crucial conservation areas, provide wildlife migration corridors, and offer tremendous public recreational opportunities and viewsheds. This request would be directed to Rappahannock River NWR (VA).

Project Description: Funds would acquire fee title in a phased acquisition totaling 148 acres in the Fones Cliff area of the Rappahannock River NWR, which will add to the Captain John Smith Chesapeake NHT. These forested bluffs reach heights of nearly 100 feet above the river shore and support high concentrations of bald eagles throughout the year. Surveys conducted by boat during winter months show the highest densities of eagles, ranging from 141 to 395 along a 30-mile stretch, with Fones Cliff consistently supporting dozens of birds. 

Many other migratory bird species use the forests, swamps, and steep ravines found on the property, including several Service or State species of conservation concern. They include the Louisiana waterthrush, ovenbird, prothonotary warbler, Kentucky warbler, worm-eating warbler, yellow-throated vireo, wood thrush, scarlet tanager, chuck-will’s widow, and whip-poor-will, all of which are confirmed breeders on the Refuge.

Overlooking a key freshwater segment of the Captain John Smith Chesapeake NHT, the 252-acre Fones Cliff project provides an opportunity for a spectacular interpretive site overlooking the Rappahannock River. State help for protection is anticipated along with $20,000 in funds for administrative costs.

The Act provided that, if the state or local governments fail to acquire or protect through written cooperative agreements lands necessary for trail purposes, the Secretary, may (I) enter into such cooperative agreements with landowners, states, local governments, private organizations, and individuals for the use of lands for trail purposes, or (ii) acquire private lands or interests therein by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds or exchange. 

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail, a series of water routes in and around Chesapeake Bay extending approximately 3,000 miles and tracing the 1607-1609 voyages of Captain John Smith to chart the lands and waterways of Chesapeake Bay. 

Threat: Development or subdivision along the trail corridor would adversely impact the historic and scenic integrity of the trail. 

Need: The requested funds will be obligated to commence the phased acquisition of the 261-acre Werowocomoco site, located along the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail at Puritan Bay on the north side of the York River in Virginia. It is expected that federal acquisition of the complete site will cost approximately $6 million. The site has been described as the most significant American Indian archaeological area in the Chesapeake Bay region. It is the location of Chief Powhatan's main residence and headquarters during the time of the English arrival at Jamestown and the location where Captain John Smith was taken after his capture. It was here that Smith met the powerful Chief Powhatan and his daughter Pocahontas. The village site is one of the most important Virginia archaeological finds in recent history and its protection, study, and interpretation to the public are of high importance. In December 2012, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources acquired a conservation easement on 57 acres of the property, providing some protection. However, the site is of such significance that public acquisition is necessary for long-term protection and visitor access."	 -   	 -

The trail totals approximately 2,174 miles. 

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: A great variety of natural, cultural, and scenic resources can be found along the trail corridor. The trail was located, where possible, to include natural and scenic resources attractive to hikers: scenic overlooks, mature forests, open fields, waterfalls, streams, shaded ravines, and cultural landscapes. Threat: The primary threat to trail integrity is incompatible use or development of lands along the trail corridor which would disrupt trail continuity, or damage natural and scenic resources.

Need: The funds would be obligated to acquire an easement interest in an 81-acre property, known as the Pomfret Pines Farm, situated on a hill adjacent to and above the Appalachian Trail in the Town of Pomfret, Vermont.

Building ecological resiliency includes maintaining intact, interconnected landscapes, and restoring fragmented or degraded (but restorable) habitats. The Act of October 3, 1980, amended the National Trails System Act to designate Ice Age National Scenic Trail as a component of the National Trails System, to be administered by the National Park Service. 

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: During the Ice Age, much of North America lay under a huge glacier. Mammoths, saber tooth cats and cave lions roamed the earth. Some of the best evidence of this glacier is found in Wisconsin’s many lakes, river valleys, gently rolling hills, and ridges. The nearly 1,200 mile Ice Age National Scenic Trail, established in 1980, traces the glacier's edge. Winding over Wisconsin’s glacial moraines, the trail links six of the nine units of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve. 

Threat: Pressure is increasing in the Ice Age/Cross Plains area to change zoning in order to permit more development. Prices for land in the area already reflect that development pressure. Timely acquisition is imperative in order to protect and make whole the glacial landscape and to preserve geological and recreational resources. 

Need: The funds will be used to acquire a 110-acre property that contains a significant glacial feature known locally as ""Table Bluff"" which is a Saint Peter sandstone cap over Prairie du Chein dolomite. The property is directly across the road from an existing segment of the Ice Age National Scenic Trail and is needed to continue the trail northward. Not only will acquisition of this parcel enable an additional segment of the Ice Age Trail, it also provides scenic views of the surrounding glacial landscape."	 -   	 -

Purchase Opportunities: Multiple riverfront opportunities, facing threats from commercial and rural development, are immediately available.

Project Description: Weaving a fragile thread of green through the high plains of central Wyoming, the vegetative corridor hugging the banks of the North Platte River represents the rarest of Western ecosystems, only 1% of land in Wyoming constitutes riparian/ wetland habitat. The 4,600-acre North Platte River Special Recreation Management Area (SRMA) includes a 45-mile segment of the North Platte, between Pathfinder National Wildlife Refuge (administered by USFWS) and the City of Casper. While the flow of the North Platte is regulated, the river remains lightly impacted by agriculture, mining, and rural residential subdivision. Native cottonwood stands along the river are critical to a wintering bald eagle population. The Oregon, California, Mormon Pioneer, and Pony Express National Historic Trails, diverging from and interpreted at Casper’s National Historic Trails Interpretive Center followed the natural contour of the North Platte River valley more than a century ago. Over 62,000 acres of sage-grouse core area combine with abundant natural resources, amidst vast relatively untrammeled landscapes. Short grass prairies and sagebrush steppe communities are intermixed with mountain shrubs bounded by riparian corridors. Uplifts along with sandstone hogbacks and cuestas add color and create diversity in this vast landscape. The combination of these varied components is critical to the life cycle and long-term survival of the sage-grouse.

An intermingled land ownership pattern stymies public access to and use of the river. Minutes away from Casper’s 50,000 residents, local outdoor enthusiasts and area visitors have turned to the BLM to address their growing demand for river access. The popularity of the Platte River Parkway, Casper’s highly successful “greenway” project initiated in 1982, and public fishing access easements purchased by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD) along the North Platte are indicators of public use. The North Platte is regarded by the WGFD as  a ""Blue Ribbon/Class I"" trout fishery."	 50,000 	 15,000

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Located in the heart of the Chigmit Mountains, the park and preserve contain great geologic diversity, including jagged peaks, granite spires, and two symmetrical active volcanoes.

Threat: Threats of residential and/or recreational development impair NPS's ability to protect the natural resources of Alaskan parks. 

Need: The requested funds will be used to acquire 5 tracts totaling 500 acres of land along the shoreline of Lake Clark within the boundary of the national park and preserve. The majority of Lake Clark's shoreline lands (approximately 60%) are in private ownership and therefore subject to subdivision, development, and the exclusion of the visiting public. The lakeshore often consists of adjoining private tracts of between 40 and 160 acres each. These tracts frequently come on the market, and the requested funds would be to purchase them as they become available. The primary value of the subject lands is their wild and undeveloped nature, and their contribution to the protection of natural and cultural resources. Purchasing these parcels will help to ensure the scenic integrity of the lake and will open more areas to public use. "	 -   	 -

The Act of March 30, 2009 (P.L. 111-11), revised the boundary of the preserve to include an additional 1,656 acres of privately owned land. The preserve presently totals 15,288 acres.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The preserve features the most extensive canyon system of the Cumberland Plateau and the second deepest gorge east of the Mississippi River. The unpolluted and near pristine Little River flows for most of its length on top of a high plateau and then deeply incises itself through the strata forming a canyon system which ranges in depth from 400 to 700 feet. A variety of rock expanses and bluffs creates a unique environment for several threatened and endangered species and for recreational pursuits, including kayaking and rock climbing. Hunting, fishing, and trapping are permitted.

Threat: Since the 1990s, some landowners within the Canyon View Forest Subdivision on the east rim have built residential structures that obstruct the view of Little River Canyon National Preserve. As a response to the housing encroachment, a boundary expansion intended to protect the canyon view was enacted (Public Law 111-11) in March 2009. The new law added to the national preserve 1,656 acres located on the east rim of the canyon and permitted the U.S. to accept donated property or to purchase property from willing sellers in the expanded boundary. 

Need: Since 2009, NPS has purchased approximately 704 acres within the boundary expansion area. The requested funds will be used to acquire fee or easement interests in 15 tracts totaling 114.45 acres available to purchase from The Conservation Fund (TCF). TCF has committed significant financial resources to acquire and protect these priority parcels in the 2009 boundary expansion area."	 -   	 -

Approximately 921 privately owned acres remain to be acquired at the park at an estimated cost of $28,000,000.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The purpose of the park is to protect natural resources, particularly the saguaro cactus which can reach heights of up to 50 feet, weigh up to 8 tons, and live for more than 150 years. The area is also home to desert tortoise, gila monsters, and other desert wildlife.

Threat: The monument consists of two units on the outskirts of Tucson: Tucson Mountain Unit (west) and Rincon Mountain Unit (east). Increasing urban encroachment and adjacent development have threatened the integrity of the monument. Stands of the saguaro cactus in the vicinity of the park have declined dramatically since the 1930s.

Need: The highest land protection priority at the park is assigned to the acquisition of 3 privately owned tracts that total 137 acres and have an estimated value of $4.375 million. The tracts are located within the park boundary, along the only significant and critical riparian area in the park. The requested funds will be used to acquire one of the tracts, a 44-acre property that is being aggressively marketed for sale. The tract currently contains some limited structures, including a caretaker’s residence and some outbuildings. The magnitude of the impact to the scenic, natural, cultural, and scientific resources of the park that would occur with further development of the property would be irreversible. Potential adverse impacts include loss of surface and ground water critical to the survival of many species, loss of native rare riparian vegetation and archaeological resources, and degradation of scenic values.

Purchase Opportunities: Fee and conservation easement acquisition opportunities of multiple large acreage ranch properties threatened with commercial, industrial, and residential development, mining, visual intrusion, and loss of T&E species habitat.

Project Description: The Panoche-Coalinga ACEC lies along the western fringe of the northern San Joaquin Valley intermingled with overlapping resource designations including the Joaquin Rocks and Serpentine ACECs, and the San Benito Mountain and Monvero Dunes Research Natural Areas. Within easy reach of the busy Interstate 5 corridor, these often-overlooked designations collectively conserve approx. 180,000 acres within a 300,000-acre mountainous setting. Buffered from urban influences, these converging mountain ranges create a landscape of striking diversity in topography, soil type, and plant communities, presenting a unique opportunity for landscape conservation on a large scale. With most of the high country already in public ownership, a handful of strategic valley acquisitions would transform this patchwork of protected lands and secure it as one of the most productive biologic landscapes in California.

The primary goal of the project is to implement the Recovery Plan for Upland Species of the San Joaquin Valley (USRP). Implementation would accomplish multiple recovery tasks listed in the plan, including endangered species connectivity and the potential to de-list several species, including the San Joaquin kit fox, blunt-nosed leopard lizard, and giant kangaroo rat, all federally-listed species. All three species occupy properties that have been identified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Endangered Species Recovery Program as crucial stepping-stones for maintaining connectivity between the Panoche Valley core populations and these species to the south.

Secondary project goals would protect the headwaters of several ecologically important drainages, conserve world class paleontological resources, expand the range of an existing elk herd, improve public access and recreation, and preserve several pristine valleys that support core T&E recovery populations identified in the USRP. The BOR and USFWS have committed $4 million over the next 5 years in support of land acquisitions to support T&E recovery."	 50,000 	 10,000

Project Description: The 250,000-acre Carrizo Plain National Monument, a majestic grassland and scenic mountainous preserve, contains the last remaining undeveloped remnant of the San Joaquin Valley ecosystem. As a result, it provides critical contiguous habitat for one of the largest assemblages of threatened and endangered species surviving on any public lands in the U.S., including the blunt-nosed leopard lizard, San Joaquin kit fox, giant kangaroo rat, Kern primrose sphinx moth, longhorn fairy shrimp, vernal pool fairy shrimp, California jewelflower, San Joaquin wooly threads, and the San Joaquin antelope squirrel.

Within the vast expanse of the Carrizo Plain lies Painted Rock, an important ceremonial site of the Chumash that rises majestically from the surrounding grassland. In addition, the Monument contains other world-class archaeological sites, which are part of a current nomination as a National Historic Landmark.

Soda Lake, a glistening bed of white salt in the dry summer, and the largest alkali wetland remaining in Southern CA, provides important habitat for migratory birds during the winter. Those interested in geology can see one of the most spectacular sections of the 800-mile long San Andreas Fault with its complex corrugated topography along the edge of the Plain.

The Monument's diversity and proximity to over 20 million people living in Southern and Central California attracts over 75,000 visitors annually who come to enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Those stopping at the Goodwin Education Center or taking guided tours to Painted Rock or the San Andreas Fault can share in the rich history of the Carrizo Plain and learn about its unique plant and animal life."	 5,000 	 1,000

Purchase Opportunities: Multiple properties facing immediate threat from commercial, industrial, rural residential and suburban development, and unregulated motorized recreational use.

Project Description: There are 88 designated Wilderness Areas encompassing over 3.9 million acres of public land in California. The first 69 Wilderness Areas were designated in southern California with the passage of the California Desert Protection Act of 1994.
Subsequently the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act, Big Sur Wilderness and Conservation Act of 2002, Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Act of 2006 and most recently the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 designated 19 additional Wilderness Areas on BLM lands in California. These Wilderness Areas stretch from the north coast of California to the peaks of the Sierra Nevada to lands along the Mexican border. 

Over 37 million people live in California. These Wilderness Areas offer places of solitude where people can experience freedom from our fast-paced industrialized society. They are places where people can renew the human spirit through association with the natural world and offer a respite from the pressure of an ever increasing urban lifestyle.

These Wilderness Areas also provide important habitat to a wide variety of animal and plant species, many threatened and endangered, and some Federally-listed species. There are six Wilderness Areas that are transected by the 2,638-mile Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail (PCT), as well as seven Wilderness Areas that are located adjacent to the Juan Bautista de Anza and Old Spanish National Historic Trails."	 10,000 	 5,000

Purchase Opportunities: The Nature Conservancy acquired these lands in 2004 as part of the creation of the Great Sand Dunes National Park & Preserve and the Baca NWR. Owner is a highly-motivated willing seller.

Project Description: Long ago, a network of playa lakes and marshes shimmered in the desert scrub of the San Luis Valley (SLV). The skies were blackened by thousands of birds drawn to these wetlands for breeding, resting, and foraging during their long migrations. During the past few decades, surface water has become significantly over-appropriated as more and more wells have been drilled into the aquifers causing the lowering of the SLV's water table. The effects have now caused these wetlands to start disappearing at a rapid rate. State and federal agencies initiated wetland restoration efforts in the 1960s as bird populations were plummeting. A critical component of the restoration efforts was the development of BLM's Blanca Wetlands Area (BWA). The newly expanded Blanca Wetlands ACEC covers over 124,000 acres, 10,000 of which are managed by BLM as a wetlands network of playa lakes, ponds, marshes, and wet meadows. BLM and its partners have made great strides in preserving and managing the Blanca Wetlands landscape to provide rich and diverse habitats for wildlife and a haven for people.

The Blanca Wetlands ACEC is an Important Bird Area in Colorado and a key site for the Intermountain West Joint Adventure shorebird science team and a nationally significant wildlife resource area. The diverse wetlands found here provide important habitats for 13 threatened and endangered species and 160 species of water birds. The project would fulfill goals identified in the Integrated Activity Plan for Blanca Wetlands (1995) by purchasing over 12,000 acres of lands bordering the northern boundary of the site. These acquisitions are imperative for connectivity of wetlands across the SLV and would essentially merge wetlands owned by BLM, the State of Colorado, NPS, FWS, and TNC. This would also encourage management across jurisdictions to achieve broad scale resource objectives."	 75,000 	 40,000

Building ecological resiliency includes maintaining intact, interconnected landscapes, and restoring fragmented or degraded (but restorable) habitats. The national monument was established in 1932 to protect some of the largest dunes in the United States. These dunes were deposited over thousands of years by southwesterly winds blowing through the passes of the lofty Sangre de Cristo Mountains. On November 22, 2000, Congress authorized establishment of Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve and abolishment of Great Sand Dunes National Monument (Public Law 106-530).

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Protection of the sand sheet, a fragile, sparsely vegetated, and easily impacted environment consisting of inactive and intermittently active dunes, is essential to the continued life of the Great Sand Dunes. The continued stability of this area depends upon the delicate balance of the area’s groundwater levels and high salinity levels.

Threat: Any changes to the natural flow patterns of the streams or groundwater levels which impact surface flows would disrupt the balance of the processes involved in continued dune activity. As the population in the area continues to grow, there will be increased pressure to use resources in a way that will adversely affect the Great Sand Dunes.

Need: The requested funds would be used to acquire the 12,518-acre Medano Ranch that is authorized for acquisition at the park. The ranch, presently owned by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), contains pre-Columbian archeological sites and historic ranch structures. This property forms one of the most spectacular landscapes in the park with the large dunes and large peaks of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains as the backdrop. TNC does not have the funding or staff to protect and restore these archeological sites (some 10,000 years old) and historic resources. Historic buildings on the property are deteriorating and each year that passes will require more preservation time and funding. Due to lack of fencing, the property is being looted and it has proven difficult for NPS rangers to prevent access across TNC lands. "	 -   	 150,000

Project Description: Funds would acquire 1,409 acres in fee title in 7 Refuge divisions located within the Connecticut River watershed. These properties include 137 acres of riparian habitat within the Westfield River Division (MA) and the Mill River Division (MA), and three tracts totaling 136 acres as part of the River’s main stem known as the Quonatuck Division located in New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut. About 1,000 acres would be added to the Mascoma Division (NH) where unfragmented forest blocks are home to a variety of rare species, exemplary natural communities, and valuable habitat for migrating and breeding birds. Another 67 acres of northern boreal forest, 13 acres in Pondicherry and 54 acres in the Mohawk River Divisions (NH), would protect nesting songbird habitat and provide the public opportunities for wildlife-dependent recreation. The Service would acquire 69 total acres in the Refuge’s Salmon River Division (CT), which contain extensive freshwater tidal marshes used by migrating and wintering waterfowl.

Acquisition of these tracts, in partnership with others, would enhance connectivity across area, elevation, latitude, aspect, and process within the 1.8 million acre Connecticut River watershed. Improving connectivity across the landscape will help waterfowl (27 species), other migratory birds (247 species), and threatened and endangered species (9 species) be resilient to temperature, precipitation and water level changes in their habitats. Connecting lands under Refuge stewardship within an extensive and expanding conservation mosaic will also promote representation, redundancy, and resiliency within the watershed. These benefits provide a robust foundation for nationally significant and vital wildlife habitat that will sustain high quality hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, environmental education, and interpretation opportunities for generations to come. The proposed acquisitions make clear and valuable contributions to each of the six legislated purposes for the Refuge while strategically integrating Service investments into the larger landscape."	 -   	 -

Building ecological resiliency includes maintaining intact, interconnected landscapes, and restoring fragmented or degraded (but restorable) habitats. The Act of December 19, 2006, amended the National Trails System Act to include Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail. The Act provided that, if the State or local governments fail to acquire or protect through written cooperative agreements lands necessary for trail purposes, the Secretary, may (I) enter into such cooperative agreements with landowners, States, local governments, private organizations, and individuals for the use of lands for trail purposes, or (ii) acquire private lands or interests therein by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds or exchange.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail, is a series of water routes in and around Chesapeake Bay extending around 3,000 miles. It traces the 1607-1609 voyages of Captain Smith to chart the lands and waterways of Chesapeake Bay. 

Threat: Development or subdivision along the trail corridor would adversely impact the historic and scenic integrity of the trail.

Need: The Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail (CAJO) consists of water routes in and around the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, extending approximately 3,000 miles and commemorating the exploratory voyages of Captain Smith in 1607-1609 and the American Indian cultures that he encountered. A component of CAJO, the Nanticoke River Water Trail follows a 64-mile route from the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland to Seaford, Delaware. This sparsely developed river corridor contains critical wildlife habitat, important fish spawning areas and significant cultural resources. The requested funds will be used to acquire the Conaway property, 174 acres of forested land along the Nanticoke River and immediately adjacent to the 4,400-acre Nanticoke Wildlife Area managed by the Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife. The property lies within the most biologically diverse watershed on the lower Delmarva Peninsula and provides critical habitat for many species and communities of conservation concern, including the federally listed Delmarva fox squirrel, Atlantic white cedar wetlands, geologically unique ancient sand ridges and many rare plant and animal species. The acquisition of this property will help conserve part of a larger forest block, protect over 3,000 feet of forested river's edge, preserve the viewshed along the trail, and aid in protecting water quality.

These diverse natural and human stories come alive where the Nassau and St. Johns rivers flow into the Atlantic Ocean—where the waters meet.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Named for the American Indians who lived here for more than 3,000 years, the preserve encompasses Atlantic coastal marshes, islands, tidal creeks, and the estuaries of the St. Johns and Nassau Rivers. Besides traces of Indian life, remains of Spanish, French and English colonial ventures can be found as well as Southern plantation life and 19th century military activities. The Battle of Thomas Creek on May 17, 1777, was the final engagement in the second of three attempts by American forces to invade east Florida during the American Revolutionary War.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The national memorial contains the Ribault Column, a replica of a column erected by the French and later demolished by the Spanish. The column was moved to the national memorial in 1958. The national memorial also contains historic earthworks significant for their role in the Civil War. Part of Jacksonville's defenses, the earthworks protected a Confederate battery overlooking the St. Johns River that was captured by the Federals in October 1862. The original structures of the French colony on the site no longer exist and were likely washed away after the river channel was deepened and widened in the 1880s. The fort exhibit was based on a 16th Century sketch by Jacques LeMoyne, the colony’s artist and mapmaker.

Threat: Spanish Pond is a contributing element to the National Register listing for Fort Caroline and has been severely impacted from residential development within its 600 acre watershed. Investigations into the source of these impacts identified storm water drainage and nutrient enrichment as primary factors in the degradation of this freshwater pond. Such impacts can be alleviated by the prevention of further residential development.

Need: The funds requested will be used to acquire, from a willing seller, the largest undeveloped tract remaining in private ownership within the national memorial. The 4.11-acre tract is adjacent to the Ribault Column and the 600-acre Theodore Roosevelt Area that preserves a vestige of the coastal wetlands that once dominated the Florida coast.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The national recreation area was established to preserve and protect the recreational and natural resources (especially water quality) of the Chattahoochee River, adjacent lands, and wetlands, from development and use which would substantially impair them. 

Threat: Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area is located within some of the fastest growing areas of the country. Open spaces along the river are being cleared at an alarming rate. These areas are being cleared and developed into subdivisions covering thousands of acres per year. Such development causes extensive erosion, siltation, and other damage to park resources. 

Need: The funds are requested to acquire two tracts totaling 20.82 acres that border a pristine section of the Chattahoochee River approximately 2.5 miles downstream of Buford Dam in northern Gwinnett County. This forested property lies in a still developing section of metropolitan Atlanta and is one of the few remaining undeveloped segments within the boundary of Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area (CRNRA). Acquisition of an additional 29-acre portion of this undeveloped property was addressed in the NPS budget request for FY 2015. The property currently forms a gap in CRNRA land holdings on the east bank of the river and serves as a crucial link to a planned public trail system extending 8 miles from Buford Dam to McGinnis Ferry Road. This property protects the watershed along the only segment of the Chattahoochee River with unimpaired water quality and preserves the outstanding scenic values in a popular area for water-based recreation. In November 2011, the property was approved for development of more than 20 high-end residential homes located along the Chattahoochee River.

The Act of November 13, 2000 (Public Law 106-510), authorized the acquisition, by donation, exchange, or purchase with donated or appropriated funds, of lands adjacent or contiguous to the park and determined to be necessary for proper rounding out of the park boundary. The act eliminated the requirement imposed by the Act of June 20, 1938, that such additional lands be acquired only by donation. 

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Erupting volcanoes, rare and endangered plant and animal communities, and prehistoric sites are featured in the park. Kipuka Pu’u Ulaual is located within the park boundary and contains platforms, terraces, shelters, trails and shrines associated with ancient Hawaiians and the early migration of Polynesians.

Threat: Residential and/or recreational development threatens the natural and cultural resources of the park. One current owner is pursuing rezoning for resort development and the other is aggressively marketing the property and applying for subdivision of more than two miles of coastline. In addition to the two subject parcels, adjacent park resources would be adversely impacted by any loss of these lands. 

Need: Part of the funds would be used to acquire a 1,951-acre parcel that contains an 8-mile long volcanic fissure known as the ""Great Crack"", numerous archaeological sites, pockets of endangered plant communities, and 2 miles of coastline.

Project Description: A portion of the LCNHT crosses a property that is being offered for sale in the Blackhawk subdivision. Acquiring these lots (totaling 20 acres) would provide public and recreational access to 4 miles of the Trail and allow for Corps of Discovery interpretive opportunities to be expanded from BLM's Discovery Hill to this area. Acquisition would also provide an emergency access route for the City of Salmon.

In 1805, the Corps of Discovery reached the headwaters of the Missouri River, crossed the Lemhi Pass into the Lemhi Valley, and encountered the central Idaho mountain barrier to the west. Here, they met Sacagawea's people, the Shoshone, who offered tremendous assistance to the Corps. William Clark took a group of men to explore the opportunity to boat the Salmon River through the mountains to reach the Pacific Ocean. Clark discovered what the Shoshone had told the Corps was true -- that the Salmon River was impassable. Clark returned and rejoined with Lewis and the main Corps of Discovery party at what is now the City of Salmon. His band crossed the two properties twice.

The Shoshone provided the Corps with horses and advised them of a long used Indian trail over what is now Lost Trail Pass to continue their efforts to find a route to the Pacific. Once again, the Lewis and Clark expedition crossed the target properties using the ancient Indian trail. Trail ruts formed by Indians dragging travois are still visible in the area."	 5,000 	 500

Project Description: Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve (CRMO) protects 750,100-acres of National Park Service and BLM land in South Central Idaho and the southwestern corridor of the High Divide Conservation Collaborative. CRMO is a member of the Pioneers Alliance, a coalition of ranchers, farmers, local residents, conservationists, agency officials and elected officials working together to accomplish common goals in Blaine and Butte counties. Conservation easements have been negotiated in both counties to protect the open spaces; the abundant wildlife; the access to the mountains, foothills, and desert; the agricultural way of life; and the small communities -- and to build an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable future.

The Pioneers Foothills encompass intact shrub habitat and provide a migration corridor between the Pioneer Mountains, Sawtooth National Forest, and CRMO. Pronghorn antelope migrate seasonally through the north end of CRMO from the Pioneer Mountains to the Birch Creek area approx.. 100 miles each way. The project area is core habitat for greater sage-grouse. More than 40 greater sage-grouse leks have been monitored in the CRMO. A portion of the Oregon National Historic Trail (i.e., Jeffrey-Goodale Cutoff) is also within the project area. The Goodale's Cutoff of the Oregon Trail is a 230-mile spur headed north form Fort Hall toward Big Southern Butte, and then through the northern part of Craters of the Moon National Monument.

The target properties are located in Blaine County near the community of Carey, ID, and have tremendous potential for rural residential development. In the last decade, many farms and ranches in the vicinity have been subdivided and developed. Recreation use within the areas is in high demand due to the magnitude of proposed development of the surrounding areas; thus changing and/or increasing the demand, type and intensity of recreational use. CRMO attracted 198,545 visitors during calendar year 2011, with visitors spending an estimated $6,821,000, resulting in 81 jobs and a $2,940,000 value added to local communities."	 500 	 500

Purchase Opportunities: Multiple willing land owners are seeking a conservation alternative for their properties to keep them as working ranches or secure in public ownership to ensure they will always make a significant wildlife contribution.

Project Description: The Sands Desert Habitat Management Area and Teton River Wildlife Corridor encompass some of the best remaining sagebrush steppe habitat, riparian, and fish habitat in Idaho. This high quality habitat supports healthy populations of two species of national importance: the greater sage-grouse (core habitat) and the Columbian sharp-tailed grouse. For Idahoans through, it is best known for its large mammal populations; more than 4,000 elk, 3,000 mule deer, and 400 moose winter on the Sands and Teton River public rangelands, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game's 35,000-acre Sand Creek Wildlife Management Area (WMA), and the adjacent private property. Much of the wildlife that people attribute to Yellowstone National Park and the surrounding National Forest lands leave those public lands in the winter to find refuge on the Sands Desert and Teton River Corridor. While IDFG's WMA is not small, the lands that have been cobbled together to date are somewhat disconnected and do not encompass some of the best habitat. The value of this habitat was recognized in the IDFG Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy, but few opportunities have come about to match wiling landowners with funds for habitat conservation.

These substantial fish and game resources also support outstanding hunting and fishing opportunities for both Idahoans and nonresidents. A high profile OHV program on the St. Anthony Sand Dunes also supports local rural economies. Additionally, the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes rely heavily on the areas to continue their aboriginal hunting and gathering Treaty rights.

Through a rigorous prioritization process, the Henrys Fork Legacy Project identified a dozen private parcels near the Sand Creek WMA and Teton River that would dramatically improve the protection offered by the WMA as well as existing conserved private properties, and would permanently protect migration corridors' land connectivity habitat. If successful, this funding would ensure the persistence of the large mammals that need the WMA and Teton River in the winter and two grouse species that can be found there year-round."	 5,000 	 1,000

Crucial wetland adjacent to sage-brush steppe habitat.

Purchase Opportunities: Private property within the area is for sale and has been subdivided, threatening migratory birds, sensitive species habitat, including year-round sage-grouse use, visual resources, cultural sites, and recreation.

Project Description: The Thousand Springs/ Chilly Slough area is one of the few remaining examples of natural, high desert, spring-fed wetlands. Winter snows melt, gather along a range-front fault and feed thousands of springs to this area. It is the largest wetland in east-central Idaho and is managed jointly by BLM and the Idaho Fish and Game.

Acquisition of the private parcels are crucial because it encompasses the headwaters of the Thousand Springs/ Chilly Slough wetlands. Land administered by BLM within the Thousand Springs/ Chilly Slough wetlands is designated ACEC and valued for its diversity of wildlife that use it. The Zollinger parcel falls within the boundary delineated in BLM's Thousand Springs/ Chilly Slough Habitat Management Plan. Acquisition will assure protection of this wildlife migration corridor and year-round habitat. Currently, the Chilly Slough Wetland Conservation Area protects almost 2,000-acres (BLM has acquired 1,028-acres and IDFG has acquired 918-acres) in public ownership. The 1999 BLM Resource Management Plan for this area allows for the creation of a wetlands management area of approx. 4,400-acres.

One hundred seventy-three wildlife species are known to use Thousand Springs/ Chilly Slough wetlands, with 113 of those being birds. These wetlands hold a high importance for migratory birds for a refueling spot during their annual migration. The riparian edge and adjacent sage-brush steppe habitat have shown to be important to sage-grouse throughout the year. Numerous historic and prehistoric archeological sites are present in and around the wetlands, and it is highly probable that other prehistoric and historic sites are located within these parcels; one prehistoric site is already known to exist on these private lands proposed for purchase. The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes have expressed interest in using this area for the practice of treaty-reserved rights. Recreational opportunities would include bird watching, hiking, fishing, canoeing, and historical education. Acquisition of this land through fee purchase would help to provide additional access to the wetlands, as well as provide connectivity between publicly managed lands for wildlife conservation."	 2,000 	 1,000

Project Description: Funds would acquire fee title to the last 35-acre in-holding left within the refuge. If the Service is unable to purchase this property while available, the land will likely be purchased by another farmer who will produce potatoes or other crops here. Before and after crops are grown, the land is highly susceptible to wind erosion, which can cause damage to surrounding Refuge land and structures.

Acquisition will also provide essential forage for waterfowl and land birds within the Pacific and Rocky Mountain migratory corridors.

Project Description: Funds would acquire fee title to private landowners’ interest both in the lakebed of Grays Lake as well as associated uplands. The lake has the world’s largest hardstem bulrush marsh and contains high elevation (6,400 feet) montane wetlands, riparian inflows and outflows with willow shrublands, and sagebrush-steppe uplands. The Refuge hosts a large nesting population of greater sandhill cranes; as many as 1,200 individuals are counted in the valley during migration and staging times, and attracts large numbers of ducks, Canada geese, and trumpeter swans. In addition, the Refuge provides important habitat for a variety of native plant and wildlife species.

The Refuge is in the shadow of the historic Caribou Mountain (9,803 feet). Grays Lake NWR provides breeding habitat for over 200 species of mammals, fish, amphibians, waterfowl, and other migratory birds. This acquisition would protect plants, fish, and wildlife, restore sagebrush habitat for the benefit of sagebrush obligate species, including Greater Sage grouse, support working farms, ranches, and forests, and protect special landscapes and historic and cultural resources. The California National Historic Trail which led over 250,000 gold-seekers to the gold fields of California during the 1840s and 1850s, is located within the project area. The land surrounding the Refuge is managed by the private landowners, State of Idaho, BIA, BLM, and USFS."	 -   	 -

Project Description: Funds would acquire approximately 2,469 acres in conservation easements in the Bear River Watershed Conservation Area. Conservation easements on private lands would be administered and monitored by the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge in Utah, the Bear Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho, and the Cokeville Meadows National Wildlife Refuge in Wyoming. The Bear River is the largest river in the Western Hemisphere that flows into the Great Salt Lake. The wide range of altitudes in the Bear River watershed allow for diverse habitats. Grassland and shrubland dominate the flats and lowlands, while pinyon-juniper woodland and pine forest cover the higher slopes. Big sagebrush is common on much of the landscape, although other shrubs, such as rabbit-brush, saltbush, and greasewood may dominate some areas.

Most of the lower elevation areas are privately owned with much of the land used for agriculture and grazing. Water from the Bear River is used to irrigate alfalfa, small grain crops, and ranchland. 

The primary routes of migratory birds following the central and Pacific flyways converge in the Bear River watershed. More than 200 bird species have been documented in the project area, with half closely associated with wetlands. Marshbirds and shorebirds include white-faced ibis, black tern, American avocet, long-billed curlew, American bittern, sandhill crane, and trumpeter swan. Upland birds include the greater sage-grouse and Columbian sharp-tailed grouse. In addition, Elk, mule deer, moose, pronghorn, bear, lynx, and wolverine depend on key wintering areas and migration corridors throughout the Bear River watershed."	 5,000 	 5,000

With less than four percent of the original acreage remaining, tallgrass prairie is one of the most endangered ecosystems in the United States. Residential, commercial, and industrial development and woody vegetation encroachment have all fragmented this important habitat. Acquisition of perpetual conservation easements from willing sellers provides permanent protection for tallgrass prairie and fosters landscape-level conservation, while helping maintain traditional ranching communities. Landowner interest is high, and the Service will focus on lands with high quality tallgrass habitat and minimal fragmentation and woody vegetation encroachment. Conservation easements also protect habitat important for the threatened Topeka shiner and a wide variety of grassland-dependent birds.

Purchase Opportunities: Acquisition of multiple parcels from willing sellers would consolidate shared BLM/MD resource management. The properties are potentially threatened with mineral and rural residential development and other nonconforming uses.

Project Description: Situated only one hour from Washington, D.C., on the tidal, lower Potomac River, the Nanjemoy Peninsula is one of the most ecologically and culturally significant landscapes remaining in Maryland. Migratory waterfowl and wading birds find shelter and abound along 10 miles of undisturbed shoreline, and an extensive network of wetlands and forest harbor some of Maryland's finest examples of rare and endangered plants and animals. Nanjemoy's outstanding natural attributes are equally matched by its archeological resources and history -- early Native American sites in the region offer a rare insight into indigenous cultures prior to European settlement, the site of a 25,000 troop Civil War encampment, and dozens of World War I-era sunken ship remains in Mallows Bay. Two water-based national trails on the Potomac River pass to the east of Nanjemoy NRMA: the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historical Trail and the Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail. A two-mile segment of the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail loops through the area. Limiting development within the Nanjemoy NRMA will preserve the historic Potomac River viewshed associated with these trails.

The State of Maryland manages several conservation areas within the Nanjemoy Peninsula, including Nanjemoy NRMA, Myrtle Grove Wildlife Management Area, Doncaster State Forest, and Purse State Park. The BLM contributes to the Nanjemoy NRMA landscape through two ""anchors"": Douglas Point SRMA and Maryland Point.

In September 2005, the State of Maryland DNR and BLM approved a long-term land management plan for the Nanjemoy NRMA that provides guidance for the sustainable protection, use, and future conservation of additional lands. BLM and Maryland DNR are working together to establish habitat linkages between these conserved areas and the Potomac River, to enhance wildlife species viability, and to protect cultural resources and watershed values."	 5,000 	 5,000

The purpose of the park is to preserve lands in the State of Maryland comprising the principal viewshed from the Mount Vernon Estate and Fort Washington across the Potomac River. Such preservation will ensure the natural beauty of such land as it existed at the time of the construction and active use of Mount Vernon Mansion and Fort Washington.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The park preserves the tranquil view from Mount Vernon of the Maryland shore of the Potomac.

Threat: An analysis completed in 1991 revealed that 98 percent of the viewshed outside the boundaries of Piscataway Park could be protected by local low density zoning which currently controls building heights. The analysis also revealed that several parcels of land, if developed in any way under existing zoning regulations, would intrude on this otherwise completely protected viewshed. 

Need: The funds are needed to acquire a one-acre tract located within the boundary of the park directly across the Potomac River from Mount Vernon. Although this improved tract is currently encumbered with a scenic easement, the construction of new, more visible structures would not be prohibited by the terms of the easement. As development pressures mount throughout the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, it is realistic to believe this property will be purchased with the intention of building a new home. The potential loss of vegetative cover and the visual intrusion of new structures would impart long-term negative impacts to the Mount Vernon and Fort Washington viewsheds."	 -   	 -

The Act of September 25, 1986, established a permanent boundary and authorized the acquisition of conservation easements on certain islands adjacent to the park.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Situated on the Maine coast in the heart of the old region of Acadia, the park conserves mountains and rugged islands that are unequaled along the eastern seaboard. The northern coniferous and temperate deciduous forests meet and overlap, bringing together nearly 1,500 species of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plant life.

Threat: Little of New England's rockbound coast remains in public ownership, undeveloped and natural. The primary threat to park resources is the development of previously undeveloped land, an action not compatible with preserving the natural and scenic resources of the area.

Need: The requested funds will be used to acquire, from willing sellers, 68 acres of forested and riparian wildlife habitat and wetlands. One tract of 62 acres is waterfront property that borders the southern shores and wetlands of Seal Cove Pond and the outlet to Seal Cove. A five-acre tract lies on the border of Round Pond and provides connectivity to habitat in the Long Pond watershed of Mount Desert Island. Acquisition of these lands would provide much needed habitat and scenic protection for the watersheds and wildlife of southeastern Maine.

Project Description: Funds would acquire a perpetual conservation easement on approximately 2,300 acres as part of the Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in the High Divide Landscape. The mountains, valleys, and rivers of the High Divide are a crucial wildlife lifeline along the spine of the continent in Idaho and Montana that link Yellowstone National Park to Idaho’s Frank Church Wilderness.

The High Divide’s boundaries are defined by tracked movements of signature wildlife: elk, pronghorn, grizzly, wolverine, sage grouse, salmon, and grayling, and its conservation vision is formed from assessments of wildlife migrations, cultural history, recreation values, and economies linking Yellowstone National Park to Idaho Wilderness. The High Divide is our nation’s top keystone region for continental scale connectivity.

Building ecological resiliency includes maintaining intact, interconnected landscapes, and restoring fragmented or degraded (but restorable) habitats. Originally designated by Executive Order as a national monument in 1910, the unit was enlarged and re-designated as Big Hole National Battlefield by the Act of May 17, 1963. The Act of October 30, 1992, further expanded the unit, adding a 355-acre property that remains privately owned. 

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The national battlefield commemorates the battle between the Nez Perce Indians and the 7th US Infantry forces in August 1877. Ninety Nez Perce men, women, and children and 30 soldiers lost their lives in the battle. The tract proposed for acquisition is of high historical and cultural significance, presumed to contain artifacts and remains from the battle. The Nez Perce regard the land as sacred and spiritual since Indian lives were lost here and it is likely that Nez Perce are buried on this tract of land; likewise, the Army suffered casualties here. The property also provides habitat for beaver, muskrat and a variety of migratory birds. 

Threat: The property proposed for acquisition is largely undeveloped and used for cattle grazing. Any development or disturbance of the property would adversely impact the historic integrity of the site and damage the artifacts and remains contained thereon.

Need: The funds would be used to acquire, from a willing seller, a conservation easement on the 355-acre property specifically authorized for protection by the Act of October 30, 1992.

Purchase Opportunities: Multiple parcels within the Monument face immediate threat of off-the-grid rural residential development. Landowners are interested in selling and third party partners are engaged.

Project Description: The 42,500-acre Rio Grande del Norte National Monument landscape is comprised of rugged, wide open plains at an average elevation of 7,000 feet, dotted by volcanic cones, and cut by steep canyons with rivers tucked away in their depths. The Rio Grande National Wild and Scenic River cares an 800-foot-deep gorge through layers of volcanic basalt flows and ash. Among the volcanic cones in the Monument, Ute Mountain is the highest, reaching 10,093 feet.

Private inholdings within the Monument are vulnerable to increasing residential and ""off-grid"" rural residential development and subdivision. Acquisition of inholdings would enhance BLM's ability to protect fragile cultural, biological, and scenic resources within the Monument, secure and increase traditional and recreational access, and prevent fragmentation of a vital interstate wildlife migration corridor and crucial winter range. Cultural significance of the area dates back 14,000 years to the Pleistocene era, when native hunters first followed the massive migrating herds of Mammuthus primigenius (wooley mammoth) and Bison antiquus (mega bison) into the region. The Plateau is rife with remains of the earliest known human cultures in the hemisphere with petroglyphs, tipi rings, wickiup structures, arrow heads, and pottery shards scattered across the landscape. Continuing archaeological investigation has documented over 500 recorded sites. Several Native American tribes and descendants of Hispanic settlers continue to use these lands as important areas for hunting, native plant and firewood gathering, and grazing. Hunting, camping, wildlife viewing, fishing, and renowned whitewater rafting contribute much-needed economic revenue to nearby rural communities. Access to the interior of the Monument and preservation of the rugged, wide-open landscape and vistas would be preserved through land acquisition.

Acquisition would also protect habitat for multiple species, including Gunnison's Prairie dog, loggerhead shrike and burrowing owl, both BLM sensitive species. The New Mexico Dept. of Fish and Game identified this area as the most important winter range habitat for elk populations moving between Colorado and New Mexico.

Purchase Opportunities: Parcel faces threat from rural residential subdivision development. Currently available from a highly-motivated willing seller.

Project Description: The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST), one of the crown jewels of the National Trails System, runs 3,100 miles between Canada and Mexico. It follows the Continental Divide of the Americas along the Rocky Mountains and traverses five U.S. states -- Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. The trail is a combination of dedicated trails and small roads and is considered 70% complete. Portions designated as incomplete must be traveled by roadwalking on dirt or paved roads.

Almost complete in New Mexico, the proposed acquisition would nearly close an existing gap and eliminate a 52-mile temporary route along state highway shoulders. The existing highway routing presents significant safety concerns and is inconsistent with the nature and purpose of the CDNST ""to provide for a high-quality scenic, primitive hiking and horseback riding opportunity and to conserve natural, historic, and cultural resources along the CDNST corridor."" The proposed rerouting is especially scenic and within the mostly undeveloped Alamocita Creek landscape. The proposed acquisition would offer a rare source of perennial water for CDNST users and cottonwood galleries providing shaded camping opportunities.

The Alamocita Creek landscape would improve public access (especially for hunting) to the Cibola National Forest, an area with a significant elk population. The parcel contains eight miles of Alamocita Creek, providing riparian habitat for many species of wildlife. The area is known for cultural sites, including those highlighting early contact between Native Americans and Europeans.

Of the privately owned lands, 269 acres remain to be acquired.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The park preserves 12,000 years of human history, including the remains of Pecos Pueblo and many other American Indian structures, Spanish colonial missions, homesteads of the Mexican era, a section of the Santa Fe Trail, sites related to the Civil War Battle of Glorieta Pass, and a 20th-century ranch.

Threat: The park is threatened by increased development activity in the area due to the growing popularity of the region. The park is located only 25 miles southeast of Santa Fe. 

Need: Public Law 111-11 of March 30, 2009, authorized the conveyance of certain federal land in Santa Fe National Forest in exchange for certain nonfederal land in Pecos National Historical Park in the State of New Mexico. The requested funds are needed to cover costs related to that exchange. The nonfederal tract contains 150.57 acres and is located in the Cañoncito Subunit of the park. The tract is a portion of a larger 440+ acre parcel slated for development as private residences. Completion of the authorized exchange will ensure that the 150.57-acre tract is protected from development."	 -   	 10,000

The Act of June 1, 1938, authorized the establishment of Saratoga National Historical Park for the purpose of preserving certain historic structures and properties associated with the American Revolution and the founding of the United States.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The Battle of Saratoga ranks among the 15 most decisive battles in world history and was the first significant American military victory during the Revolution. Here in 1777 American forces met, defeated and forced a major British army to surrender, an event which led France to recognize the independence of the United States and enter the war as a decisive military ally of the struggling Americans. The 3,410-acre park now comprises 3 separate units: the 4-square-mile Battlefield in Stillwater, NY, the General Philip Schuyler House 8 miles north in Schuylerville and the Saratoga Monument in the nearby village of Victory.

Threat: Saratoga County is one of the fastest growing counties in the country. Residential and commercial developments present an increasing threat to the historic resources of the park.

Need: The funds requested will be obligated to acquire to acquire a tract containing 182 acres of land located outside of and adjacent to the current park boundary. The tract was purchased by the NYS Open Space Conservancy in 2005 on the behalf of the park.  Existing authority will be used to include the tract within the park. The tract includes a portion of the primary road used by the advancing British troops, contains the third hill associated with British Hudson River defensive positions, and offers outstanding views of the American river fortifications at the south end of the park.

Purchase Opportunities: Acquisition of key parcels from willing sellers in order to increase the connectivity of protected Monument lands and biologic, geologic and hydrologic resources.

Project Description: Fir forests, oak groves, wildflower meadows and steep canyons make the 85,105-acre Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument (CSNM) an ecological wonder, with biological diversity unmatched in the Cascade Range. A tremendous variety of plants and animals make homes amidst the Monument's towering forests, sunlit groves, wildflower-strewn meadows, and steep canyons. The Monument is a bird sanctuary, with more than 200 species identified, including the Northern Spotted Owl, the Great Gray Owl, the Peregrine Falcon, and the Willow Flycatcher.

The properties proposed for acquisition include a mix of Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, other conifers and oak species. They also contain alpine meadows supporting wildflowers, including the rare Greene's Mariposa Lily. The parcels are bordered by BLM-identified Old Growth Emphasis and Diversity Emphasis Areas, including Soda Mountain Wilderness, and provide important connectivity within the Monument's ecosystem. Several parcels make up the ""land bridge"" between the mountain systems and the eco-regions. Multiple properties include cold-water springs containing rare and endemic snails. The CSNM provides habitat for three endemic bureau sensitive fish species: Jenny Creek suckers, the speckled dace, and a long-isolated stock of reband trout. The lands support populations of white-headed woodpecker, western pond turtle, and beaver.

Preserve North Umpqua National Recreation Trail accessibility and quality.

Purchase Opportunities: Multiple parcels within the North Umpqua NWSR corridor face county divestment. Strong support from the local community and across Oregon for BLM to secure perpetual ownership and guarantee public access.

Project Description: The unique, emerald green waters of the North Umpqua NWSR originate high in the Cascade Mountains, near Crater Lake National Park. The river's reputation as a world-class steelhead stream and its famous emerald water results from the river's source being high enough in the Cascades to derive from snowmelt during the entire year. The melting snow is trapped in volcanic soil and pumice and released during the summer months, providing an even cool-temperature flow. The North Umpqua is one of two rivers in Oregon that flows directly from the Cascades to the Pacific Ocean.

The North Umpqua National Recreation Trail parallels the North Umpqua for 80 miles. Over this distance the trail descends 5,000 vertical feet, propelling trail users on a journey through deep dark canyons and past waterfalls, volcanic rock cliffs, and pristine, towering old growth forests. The trail affords public access to the North Umpqua's hidden holes and riffles offering challenges to fly-fishing anglers. The world renowned North Umpqua is known as one of the top 10 fly-fishing destinations in the world. Zane Grey, the famous author and sportsman, maintained a camp along the North Umpqua in the 1930s and was a strong advocate for protection of the river's fisheries. The trail is labeled as one of 59 ""Epic Rides"" in the world by the International Mountain Biking Association. Over 250,000 annual visitors experience the water quality and quantity, recreation, scenic, fish, wildlife, and cultural values of the corridor. The corridor provides critical habitat to two federally-threatened species, the Oregon Coast Coho Salmon and northern spotted owl, as well as the American bald eagle, a BLM sensitive species.

In addition to the NWSR designation, the proposed acquisition is within the Rogue-Umpqua National Scenic Byway, North Umpqua SRMA, and is designated an Oregon State Scenic Waterway. Acquisition of the parcel is imperative to protect the remarkable values of the corridor and to consolidate federal ownership. Recent timber clear cuts abutting the proposed acquisition threaten the unique values of the corridor."	 10,000 	 5,000

The Act of August 17, 1990, revised the boundary and authorized the appropriation of such funds as necessary for land acquisition at Gettysburg National Military Park. The act added 1,791 acres of privately owned land to the park. A total of 912 acres remain to be acquired in the park after fiscal year 2014. Of that amount, 143 acres with an estimated value of $5,200,000 are located in the older inholding area of the park.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The great Civil War battle fought here July 1-3, 1863, repulsed the second Confederate invasion of the North. Gettysburg National Cemetery -- more than 7,000 interments, 1,668 unidentified -- adjoins the park. At the dedication of the cemetery on November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered his timeless Gettysburg Address.

Threat: There is intense pressure to commercially develop privately owned lands in and around Gettysburg National Military Park. Such development would threaten the historic integrity of the park.

Need: The requested funds are needed to acquire, from a willing seller, an 18.12-acre tract containing the remains of McAllister's Mill, the only documented Underground Railroad site within the boundary of Gettysburg National Military Park. The McAllister family was active in the abolitionist and Underground-Railroad movement in the first half of the nineteenth century. Their buildings, primarily the grist mill, were used as stations on the Underground Railroad in which fugitive slaves were sheltered on their way to New York and Canada. The tract contains many landscape features and structures that affected the outcome of the battle or were used for field hospitals. It also features the hill associated with the McAllister farm buildings, where, using fences and stone walls, Union sharpshooters controlled the grounds below them and prevented Confederate incursions to the major logistical supply line and rear of the Union army at Baltimore Pike. The acquisition of this tract will preserve the remaining foundations of the McAllister Buildings, as well as significant historic landscape features."	 12,000 	 -

The Wild and Scenic River contains 5,073 acres, of which 1,034 acres are privately owned. Acquisition efforts have been focused on the highest priority tracts for which acquisition of fee interest is necessary in order to acquire the needed visitor-use areas.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: Forty-five miles of free-flowing streams are protected within the OBED boundary, offering Class II through IV whitewater, camping, hiking, and other activities.

Threat: As the population around OBED continues to grow, pressure for new housing in the area continues to increase. Development of the tracts proposed for acquisition would be in direct conflict with the legislation that mandated preservation of the river in a “wild” condition.

Need: The requested funds would be used to acquire 7 tracts totaling 450.69 acres of land at OBED. Six tracts are critical for the protection of the resources, viewshed and recreational opportunities of the most scenic and popular stream sections in the entire park. Taken altogether, the number of river miles that would receive complete viewshed protection through the purchase of these six tracts would be more than half of the river miles authorized for OBED by Congress. The land immediately surrounding these six tracts is being aggressively developed. On several tracts, good quality roads lead to likely building sites both on the high ridges and cliffs overlooking the river and on extensive flat land immediately adjoining the river. The existence of such infrastructure classifies these six tracts as imminently developable. The seventh tract contains 29.23 acres of privately owned land and its location is known as ""Obed Junction"", the most important put-in and take-out spot for whitewater paddlers along the Obed River.

Purchase Opportunities: Multiple inholding parcels are immediately available from highly-motivated willing sellers.

Project Description: The 90,000-acre Colorado Riverway SRMA is one of Utah's busiest recreation areas. More than 800,000 visitors annually enjoy the scenic and recreational opportunities offered within this area, including 60,000 visitors who float (many with local outfitters) the ""daily"" stretch of the Colorado River that flows through the SRMA. The river is an important economic asset to the local community, supporting many local river-running businesses. The SRMA contains 9 developed boating access facilities, 22 campgrounds, 8 non-motorized trailheads, and 3 trailheads used by both motorized and non-motorized users. The SRMA contains Moab's most popular hiking trails, including Corona Arch, Negro Bill Canyon, and Fisher Towers (a National Recreation Trail), as well as several of the most popular rock climbing areas in southeastern Utah. The spectacular ""red-rock"" scenery afforded by the Colorado Riverway is the main draw for all of these activities. The SRMA also provides habitat for federal T&E and state listed sensitive species, such as several native fish species, the Mexican spotted owl, Southwest Willow Flycatcher, and several types of plants.

The BLM Moab Field Office has an ongoing program to acquire private parcels within the Colorado Riverway SMA to protect scenic and recreational values. Past acquisitions were accomplished by both purchase and exchange.

Purchase Opportunities: Acquisition of these pivotal parcels from motivated willing seller would consolidate resource management. The properties are potentially threatened with deforestation, rural residential development and other nonconforming uses.

Project Description: Established in 2001 and managed by the BLM-Eastern States Office, the 802-acre Meadowood SRMA is a key component of the parks, refuges, and other preserves on the Mason Neck Peninsula that have been protected from encroaching urban development radiating south from metropolitan Washington, D.C. The landscape is a mosaic of gently sloping open meadows, mature hardwood forests, freshwater ponds, creeks, streams, and riparian wetlands.

Two national trail segments pass through Meadowood SRMA: the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail and the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail. These national trail segments help make up Meadowood's 15-mile, multiple-use trail system, which provides opportunities for hiking, running, mountain biking, and horseback riding. One universally accessible trail is incorporated within the trail system. The proposed acquisitions would permit BLM to significantly expand and enhance the existing trail system, conserve and restore strategic wetland and buffer areas, and establish a defined boundary along Gunston Road. Additional day-use disbursed recreational activities at Meadowood include wildlife viewing, fishing, seasonal hunting, nature photography, geocaching, environmental education, and interpretation. The SRMA attracts more than 22,000 annual recreational visitors and reaches more than 700 area youth through a variety of educational and recreational programs, including Hands on the Land and Take It Outside.

The diverse Meadowood habitat supports a great variety of wildlife, including white-tailed deer, red fox, coyote, beaver, raccoons, hawks, eagles, reptiles, and amphibians. Home to 30 species of migratory birds, the SRMA lies within the National Audubon Society's Lower Potomac River Important Bird Area. Meadowood contains some of the best mature hardwood forest on the Mason Neck peninsula as well as less mature woodlands. Woody plans common to the woodlands, forests, and forest edges at Meadowood include red and white oak, beech, sweet gum, Virginia pine, persimmon and paw paws. The trails at Meadowood pass through a wide variety of terrain and vegetation types, providing visitors with constantly changing seasonal experiences."	 100,000 	 5,000

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: This rural district preserves and protects an unbroken historical record of Puget Sound exploration and settlement from the 19th Century to the present. Historic farms, still under cultivation in the prairies of Whidbey Island, reveal land use patterns unchanged since settlers claimed the land in the 1850s under the Donation Land Claim Act. The Victorian seaport community of Coupeville is also in the reserve.

Threat: In seeking to alleviate economic hardship, some landowners at the reserve are considering a change from historical land use patterns to more lucrative means of land use, such as subdivision for multiple commercial and/or residential purposes.

Need: The requested funds will be used to acquire conservation easements on four tracts totaling 164.58 acres located in the north end of the reserve, which has experienced tremendous growth and development in recent years, threatening the integrity of the cultural landscape and the historic patterns of land use. These historic agricultural patterns are visible from Coupeville (a primary visitor viewing area) and along the S/SW side of Penn Cove. The loss of the farmland and open space would threaten the scenic and historic integrity of the reserve's north end.

After fiscal year 2014, 327 tracts totaling 353 acres (estimated value: $20 million) within the park remain to be acquired.

Natural/Cultural Resources Associated with Proposal: The park is largely a wilderness area featuring rugged glacier-capped mountains, deep valleys, lush meadows, sparkling lakes, giant trees, 57 miles of unspoiled beaches, teeming wildlife such as Roosevelt elk and Olympic marmot, and the most spectacular temperate rain forest in the world.

Threat: Acquiring properties in the subdivision of the Lake Quinault area is important to protecting the park resources. These include water quality of the streams, creeks and rivers which are impacted by continual development in the area and current private consumption demands for these resources. It is known that some improved properties in this area have direct discharge of domestic sewage that presently flow into the lake.

Need: The highest land protection priority at the park is assigned to the acquisition of 10 privately owned acres that have a total estimated value of $5.2 million and are located in the Lake Quinault section of the park. The requested funds will be used to acquire, from willing sellers, two of the Lake Quinault acres. Acquisition in the Lake Quinault section is necessary to protect the water quality of the streams, creeks and rivers located in Lake Quinault section of park therein which are threatened by continual development and consumption demands for these resources.

Purchase Opportunities: Multiple riverfront opportunities, facing threats from commercial and rural residential development and mining, are immediately available.

Project Description: Weaving a fragile thread of green through the high plains of central Wyoming, the vegetative corridor hugging the banks of the North Platte River represents the rarest of Western ecosystems, only 1% of land in Wyoming constitutes riparian/wetland habitat. The 4,600-acre North Platte River SRMA includes a 45-mile segment of the North Platte, between Pathfinder NWR (administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) and the City of Casper. While the flow of the North Platte is regulated, the river remains highly impacted by agriculture, mining, and rural residential subdivision. Native cottonwoods stands along the river are critical to a wintering bald eagle population. The Oregon, California, Mormon Pioneer, and Pony Express National Historic Trails, diverging from and interpreted at Casper's National Historic Trails Interpretive Center, were established along the natural contour of the North Platte River valley more than a century ago.

An intermingled land ownership pattern stymies public access to and use of the river. Minutes away from Casper's 50,000 residents, local outdoor enthusiasts and area visitors have turned to BLM to address their growing demand for river access. The popularity of the Platte River Parkway, Casper's highly successful ""greenway"" project initiated in 1982, and public fishing easements purchased by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department along the North Platte are indicators of public use. The North Platte is regarded by the WGFD as a ""Blue Ribbon/Class I"" trout fishery.

The project area overlaps 62,000 acres of Greater Sage-grouse core habitat amidst a vast, relatively untrammeled landscape of short grass prairies and sagebrush steppe communities intermixed with mountain shrubs and bounded by riparian corridors. Uplifts along with sandstone hogbacks and cuestas add color and create visual diversity.
