<h3><a name="intro" class="communities_content-heading js-comm_section">{{ page.title }}</a></h3>

Gold is a precious mineral, highly valued for its durability and beauty. It is used to make jewelry and art, and has technological uses such as memory chip conductors and reflective satellite coverings. In 2013, the United States was the third largest producer of gold, extracting 227 tons valued at $10.2 billion.[^1] The United States gold reserves, with an estimated size of 3,000 tons, are the fifth largest in the world.[^2] Within the United States, the Great Basin, located primarily in Nevada, accounts for 74% of total gold production.[^3]

<h3><a name="geolo" class="communities_content-heading js-comm_section">Geology and History</a></h3>

Mineral mining in Nevada began shortly after the onset of the California Gold Rush in 1849. The 1859 discovery of the Comstock Lode silver deposit in the Virginia Range of western Nevada was the first major discovery of silver ore in the country.[^4] All told, the Great Basin geological region, which covers most of Nevada and crosses into Oregon, Utah, and California, has a total resource potential that exceeds 3,200 metric tons (100,000,000 ounces) of gold.[^5]

The major gold mines in Humboldt and Lander counties represent more recent production operations. Neither of the counties’ two largest mines, the Twin Creeks Mine in Humboldt nor the Pipeline/Cortez Hills Mine in Lander, started producing gold until the early 1990s. These mines are now two of the largest gold producers in the state.

<h3><a name="produ" class="communities_content-heading js-comm_section">Production</a></h3>

Nevada is currently experiencing the biggest gold boom in US history, which began in 1981 and has produced over 240 million ounces, often from public lands.[^6] This surge in production is largely the result of discovering deposits that contain microscopic gold particles.[^7] These deposits occur when gold is deposited quickly and disseminated into the surrounding rock.

The two major gold-mining companies behind this development are Newmont Mining Corporation and Barrick Gold Corporation, which operate open pit mining operations.[^8] Gold production in Humboldt and Lander counties totaled 2,419,790 ounces in 2012, accounting for 43% of the state’s total gold production that year.[^9]

<h3><a name="emplo" class="communities_content-heading js-comm_section">Employment</a></h3>

Gold extraction provided jobs for 3,704 workers and 2,156 contractors in 2012, which represents 25% of the entire county population of 22,981, and 58% of total employment in the two counties.[^10] [^11]

<h3><a name="reven" class="communities_content-heading js-comm_section">Revenue</a></h3>

Gold-mining serves as a key driver of funding for local government across the state. In addition to various property and sales taxes, counties receive annual revenue from the gold industry, largely from the state’s Net Proceeds of Minerals Tax. This tax is considered to be an ad valorem property tax assessed on minerals produced in the state, applied at a rate of 5% on royalties and all other net proceeds exceeding $4 million. In FY 2012, Nevada counties received $117 million in revenue from minerals taxes.[^12] [^13] Of that total, $71 million went to these two counties.[^14]

<h3><a name="costs" class="communities_content-heading js-comm_section">Costs</a></h3>

A number of state-level resources, which are listed below, shed light on Humboldt and Lander County transportation systems, reclamation procedures, and emergency services. While these government publications discuss costs to the state government, they do not explicitly discuss the fiscal costs of gold extraction to the Humboldt and Lander county governments.
