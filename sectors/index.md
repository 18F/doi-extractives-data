U.S. Natural Resource Sectors
=============================

<!-- ##Renewable Energy

In FY 2013, Interior lands and facilities produced 40 million MWh of hydropower. Also, in FY 2013, Interior approved the installation of 826 MW of wind capacity and 1,000 MW of solar power projects on public lands. Renewable energy activities were estimated to contribute about $5 billion in output and support over 20,000 jobs. In aggregate, generating electricity with renewable energy reduces the amount of electricity supplied by fossil fuel plants, along with the associated emissions, and reduces our Nation’s dependence on foreign oil.

Market values of power typically do not reflect the adverse environmental and health costs to
society associated with fossil fuel pollution or the corresponding benefits to society from
substituting cleaner sources of energy.

##Fossil Fuel Energy

In FY 2013, Interior‐managed lands and waters produced 652 million barrels of crude oil, 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 420 million tons of coal. Some average prices in FY 2013 included $101/bbl for oil, $3.72/mcf of natural gas, and $11 per ton of Powder River Basin coal. Oil, gas and coal produced from Interior lands were estimated to provide value added of $121 billion; estimated economic output contribution of $220 billion; and an estimated 1 million jobs. External costs are associated with the development of oil, gas, and coal produced from Interior lands, and with the production and the use of these resources. Market prices do not fully reflect these costs. Various regulations and other requirements designed to minimize adverse environmental impacts internalize some (but not all) of these external costs. -->




##Nonrenewable Energy

Coal, petroleum, natural gas, and propane are all considered fossil fuels because they were formed from the buried remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Uranium ore, a solid, is mined and converted to a fuel used at nuclear power plants. Uranium is not a fossil fuel, but is a nonrenewable fuel.

>Fossil Fuels Are Nonrenewable, but <br/>
>Not All Nonrenewable Energy Sources Are Fossil Fuels

Nonrenewable energy sources come out of the ground as liquids, gases, and solids. Crude oil (petroleum) is the only commercial nonrenewable fuel that is naturally in liquid form. Natural gas and propane are normally gases, and coal is a solid.


###Crude Oil
Crude oil is produced in 31 states and U.S. coastal waters. In 2012, 61% of U.S. crude oil production came from five states:

+ Texas (31%)
+ North Dakota (10%)
+ California (8%)
+ Alaska (8%)
+ Oklahoma (4%)

As of 2012, about 20% of U.S. crude oil was produced from wells located offshore in federally administered waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

Although total U.S. crude oil production generally declined between 1985 and 2008, it has been increasing since 2008. More cost effective drilling technology has helped boost production, especially in North Dakota, Texas, and the offshore Gulf of Mexico.

###Natural Gas Plant Liquids
Natural gas plant liquids (NGPL) are liquids that are separated from natural gas at processing plants and are important ingredients for manufacturing plastics and gasoline. Propane is the only NGPL that is widely used for heating and cooking. Production of NGPL fluctuates with natural gas production, but their share of total U.S. petroleum production has increased from 8% in 1950 to 27% in 2012.

In 2012, the United States relied on net imports (imports minus exports) for about 40% of the petroleum that we used.

U.S. natural gas production and consumption were nearly in balance through 1986. After that, consumption began to outpace production, and imports of natural gas rose to meet U.S. demand for the fuel. Production increased from 2006 through 2011, when it reached the highest recorded annual total since 1973. The increases in production were the result of more efficient, cost-effective drilling techniques, notably in the production of natural gas from shale formations.

Share of 2011 natural gas marketed production:

+ Texas (29%)
+ Louisiana (13%)
+ Wyoming (9%)
+ Federal Offshore Gulf of Mexico (8%)
+ Oklahoma (8%)

The United States consumes more natural gas than it produces. While most of the natural gas consumed in the United States is produced domestically, imports from other countries are also an important source of supply. 

> The United States is a "net importer" of natural gas, <br/>
> meaning that it imports more natural gas than it exports.

Reliance on natural gas imports has declined in recent years due to a surge in natural gas production, resulting from more efficient, cost-effective drilling techniques, notably in the production of natural gas from shale formations. Net imports (imports minus exports) of natural gas accounted for 6% of U.S. natural gas consumption in 2012, compared to the 2007 peak of 16%.

Natural gas can be transported in two ways:

1. **Via pipeline.** There are more than 210 natural gas pipeline systems.
2. **Via ship.** Natural gas is shipped in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

In 2012, 94% of net imports came by pipeline, primarily from Canada, and 10% came by liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers carrying gas from around the world.

About 25% of energy used in the United States came from natural gas in 2012. The United States used 25.46 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas in 2012.

Natural gas is used to produce steel, glass, paper, clothing, brick, electricity, and as an essential raw material for many common products. Some products that use natural gas as a raw material are: paints, fertilizer, plastics, antifreeze, dyes, photographic film, medicines, and explosives.

Slightly more than half of the homes in the United States use natural gas as their main heating fuel. Natural gas is also used in homes to fuel stoves, water heaters, clothes dryers, and other household appliances.

The major consumers of natural gas in the United States in 2012 included:

+ Electric power sector (9.1 trillion cubic feet, or Tcf)
+ Industrial sector (7.1 Tcf)
+ Residential sector (4.2 Tcf)
+ Commercial sector (2.9 Tcf)

Natural gas is used throughout the United States, but the top natural gas consuming states in 2011 were Texas, California, Louisiana, Florida, New York, and Illinois.

###Coal
Coal is a nonrenewable energy source because it takes millions of years to develop. The energy in coal comes from the energy stored by plants that lived hundreds of millions of years ago when the earth was partly covered with swampy forests. Coal is classified into four main types, or ranks (anthracite, bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite). Classification depends on the amounts and types of carbon the coal contains and on the amount of heat energy the coal can produce. The rank of a deposit of coal depends on the pressure and heat that acted on the plant debris as it sank deeper and deeper over millions of years. For the most part, the higher ranks of coal contain more heat-producing energy.

In 2012, 1,016.4 million short tons of coal were mined in 25 states. Wyoming mined the most coal, followed by West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Illinois.

> Coal is mainly found in three large regions: <br/>
> the Appalachian coal region, the Interior coal region, and <br/>
> the Western coal region (which includes the Powder River Basin).

**Appalachian coal region.** Almost 29% of the coal produced in the United States comes from the Appalachian coal region.
West Virginia is the largest coal-producing state in the region, and the second-largest coal-producing state in the United States. Coal mined in the Appalachian coal region is primarily used for steam generation for electricity, coke production, and for export.

**Interior coal region.** Illinois is the largest coal producer in the Interior coal region, accounting for more than a fourth, or almost 27% of the region's coal production. The Interior coal region has mid-sized surface mines.

**Western coal region.** More than half of the coal produced in the United States is produced in the Western coal region. Wyoming is the largest coal producer in this region, as well as the largest coal-producing state in the nation. Nine of the top 10 producing coal mines in the United States are located in Wyoming. The Western coal region has many large surface mines. Some of the largest coal mines in the world are in the Western coal region.

About 93% of the coal consumed in the United States is used in the electric power sector. The remaining 7% of coal is used as a basic energy source in many industries including the steel, cement, and paper industries.

Coal is used to create about 39% of all the electricity generated in the United States. Power plants can make steam by burning coal. The steam then turns turbines (machines for generating rotary mechanical power) to generate electricity.

In addition to companies in the electric power sector, industries and businesses with their own power plants use coal to generate electricity.


##Renewable Energy

In 2012, consumption of renewable sources in the United States totaled about 9 quadrillion Btu (1 quadrillion is a number 1 followed by 15 zeros) or about 9% of all energy used nationally. About 12% of U.S. electricity was generated from renewable sources in 2012.

Over half of renewable energy goes to producing electricity. The next largest use of renewable energy is biomass (wood and waste) for the production of heat and steam for industrial purposes and for space heating, mostly in homes. Biomass also includes biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, used for transportation.

Renewable energy plays an important role in the supply of energy. When renewable energy sources are used, the demand for fossil fuels is reduced. Unlike fossil fuels, non-biomass renewable sources of energy (hydropower, geothermal, wind, and solar) do not directly emit greenhouse gases.

Most of the geothermal power plants in the United States are located in the western states and in Hawaii where geothermal energy resources are close to the earth's surface. California generates the most electricity from geothermal energy. [The Geysers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geysers) dry steam reservoir in northern California is the largest known dry steam field in the world and has been producing electricity since 1960.

The United States leads the world in the amount of electricity generated with geothermal energy. In 2013, U.S. geothermal power plants produced about 17 billion kilowatthours (kWh), 0.4% of total U.S. electricity generation. In 2013, six states had geothermal power plants.

Share of U.S. geothermal electricity produced by each state in 2013:

+ California (78%)
+ Nevada (17%)
+ Utah (2%)
+ Hawaii (2%)
+ Oregon (1%)
+ Idaho	(1%)

##Other Products: Non‐fuel Minerals

In FY 2013, Federal lands produced a wide variety of minerals. For example, it is estimated that about 2.4 million ounces of gold were produced from Federal lands in Nevada; the average price of gold in 2013 was $1,400 per ounce. Non‐fuel mineral production was associated with an estimated value added of $7.9 billion; estimated economic output of $12.5 billion; and estimated employment supported about 45,900 jobs. While minerals are generally traded in competitive markets (though some markets may be localized or thin), prices may not incorporate the external costs associated with mining. Moreover, the Federal leasing system completely offset these costs, which are primarily associated with the environmental impacts of mining. Various regulations and other requirements designed to minimize adverse environmental impacts help to internalize some of these external costs. *[U.S. Department of the Interior Economic Report FY 2013 DRAFT]*

*[The following is from the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of the Interior, 2011 Minerals Yearbook - STATISTICAL SUMMARY. NB: the 2012 report is behind but should be released by December]*

The total value of all nonfuel mineral production (or “mine output,” which refers to minerals or ores in the form in which they are first extracted from the ground, but customarily may include the output from auxiliary processing at or near the mines) in the United States in 2011 increased to $74.7 billion, which was a 13% increase compared with that of 2010; metals increased to $36.0 billion, which was an increase of 19%; and industrial minerals increased to $38.7 billion, an increase of 7%. 

In 2011, the value of nonfuel mineral commodity production for the following 14 mined commodities, in descending order of production value, was greater than $1 billion: gold, stone (crushed), copper, sand and gravel (construction), cement (portland), iron ore (usable shipped), molybdenum concentrates, phosphate rock (marketable), lime, sand and gravel (industrial), salt, zinc, soda ash, and silver. They accounted for 90% of the U.S. total production value.

In 2011, the value of nonfuel mineral commodity production in the following 21 States, in descending order of production value, was greater than $1 billion: Nevada, Arizona, Minnesota, Utah, Alaska, Florida, California, Texas, Michigan, Missouri, Wyoming, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Montana, New York, Idaho, New Mexico, Virginia, Kansas, and Illinois. They accounted for 82% of the U.S. total production.
