# Buttons

Buttons represent a clear action for a user to perform.


## How to use

Buttons use the `button` element and the variant is controlled by class name
e.g. `button-primary`.


## Variants


### Primary

```
<Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>
```

Primary buttons are used sparingly on the site, reserved for links to
higher-profile content like in a hero component.


### Secondary

```
<Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>
```

The secondary and disabled button styles are not in use at all, but may be handy
if forms are created in the future.

### Tertiary

```
<Button variant="tertiary">Tertiary</Button>
```

### Disabled

```
<Button variant="disabled">Disabled</Button>
```

The secondary and disabled button styles are not in use at all, but may be handy
if forms are created in the future.
