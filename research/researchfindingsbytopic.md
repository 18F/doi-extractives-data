Studies: Home Page Sept 2018, Key Facts/Explore Data Aug 2018, Key Facts June 2018, Disbursements Round 1 May 2018, Inquisitive impala (unknown #), Randy Roo (unknown #), Splashy Sunfish (unknown #)

### Details

The current Explore Data page is unwieldy.  
- The map at the top doesn't orient users to what is on the page
- Download functionality is buried when users expect the two functions to be integrated
- Many users don't make it to the bottom or see all the sections because it's so long
- Many users get lost in the middle of the page
- Users don't get a good sense of what the sections (production, revenue, and disbursements) are about and how they relate to each other

### Details

Users think monthly data is useful. Mostly to see how the current year is going to far, which requires being able to compare against how it compares to the prior year.

 ## Home Page Content

Studies: Home Page Sept 2018, Key Facts/Explore Data Aug 2018, Inquisitive impala (unknown #)

### Details
The home page with key facts doesn't do a good job of orienting new users to how the process works.
- The key facts are disorienting if you don't already know what the site does.
- Many participants didn't notice the content below the key facts.
 
 | Solution | Github Issue(s) |

 | Rework the How it Works content on the homepage to reduce disorientation from key facts. | [Tabbed how it works content](https://github.com/ONRR/doi-extractives-data/issues/3287)|
