This is a summary of the open research findings, by topic, so we can get a sense for trends across studies and help prioritize fixes.
# Planned updates
These are topics for which we have explore solutions and have in the plan to address.

## Explore Data split
| Severity | Frequency |
| - | - |
| High | 30+ participants |

Studies: Home Page Sept 2018, Key Facts/Explore Data Aug 2018, Key Facts June 2018, Disbursements Round 1 May 2018, Inquisitive impala (unknown #), Randy Roo (unknown #), Splashy Sunfish (unknown #)

### Details

The current Explore Data page is unwieldy.  
- The map at the top doesn't orient users to what is on the page
- Download functionality is buried when users expect the two functions to be integrated
- Many users don't make it to the bottom or see all the sections because it's so long
- Many users get lost in the middle of the page
- Users don't get a good sense of what the sections (production, revenue, and disbursements) are about and how they relate to each other

The home page with key facts doesn't do a good job of orienting new users to how the process works.

| Saving Data |	Nobody wanted the ability to save filters because they usually don't need to answer the same question twice. |	5	participants | Disbursements Round 1 May 2018 |
| Email Data |	Many participants liked the option to email the data, but had mixed expectations about what would be emailed. |	4	participants | Disbursements Round 1 May 2018 |
| Case Studies	| User like the case studies. <br> He’s interested in comparing against other counties and thought the case studies were an interesting way to do this. |	3	participants | Home Page Sept 2018 <br> Key Facts/Explore Data Aug 2018 <br> Key Facts June 2018 |
| Create Charts	| Users want to be able to create their own charts from the data using the site.	| 3	participants | October 2018 Interviews <br> Key Facts June 2018 <br> Disbursements Interviews Apr 2018 |
| Revenue & Disbursements | A couple participants noticed that revenue and disbursements didn't match up. <br> P4: Noticed that revenue and disbursements don’t match up. <br> P5: Disbursements: Ok, so I’m looking at all funds, doesn’t seem like it is quite the same number as revenues <br> Wants to see revenue and disbursements data tied together, so he can track funds across the process. |	3	participants | Key Facts/Explore Data Aug 2018 <br> Disbursements Round 2 June 2018 |
| EITI	| Noted that we need to be clear about what we're keeping from EITI and what our mission is now.	| 2 participants |	Disbursements Round 2 June 2018 |
| Chart interactivity	| Users want the summary graphics to be interactive.	| 2	participants | October 2018 Interviews <br> Key Facts/Explore Data Aug 2018 |
| IE Bugs | Bugs in IE: Overlapping links on About page in Gatsby, broken map <br> She uses IE and the site is broken. | 2 participants | Home Page Sept 2018 <br> Disbursements Round 2 June 2018 |
| Language: Extractive	| Thought the word “extractive” might be construed as political, but couldn’t come up with a better word. <br> I’m not exactly sure what “extractive industries” means, but I like the summary | 2 participants | Home Page Sept 2018 <br> Key Facts/Explore Data Aug 2018 |
| Language: Federal (on state pages) | Am I still just on the State of TX? I guess so, but I’m confused when I see federal revenue <br> Possibly because the federal land percentage was the first thing visible, one user expressed confusion about whether the entire scope of the page would be limited to federal land. (on a state page) |	2 participants | Key Facts/Explore Data Aug 2018 <br> Randy Roo |
| Number Formats	| Wasn’t sure if the GOMESA numbers were in thousands. <br> Thinks in terms of how budget formats for numbers (expected ,000s to be cut off) (P5) | 2 participants |	Key Facts June 2018 |

| Economic Impact | Liked GDP and employment data. <br> People really gravitated to this section, and seemed to understand why this was an important measure. <br> One tester wanted to be able to sort this table by number or percentage. <br> Several testers had existing perceptions about extractives employment, and were looking at this section to validate those perceptions. <br> There’s huge concern about native rights, subsistence rights, access, scope, — what’s most important is often about the impact on the people, as much as about the ownership/money. Protected impacts, and scope; the stories tend to focus around that rather than revenue. | 1+ participant | Key Facts/Explore Data Aug 2018 <br> Randy Roo (unknown #) <br> Sarcastic Seacow (unknown #) |

| Language: Explore Data |	Explore data - said the term felt too technical. Expected it to be digging into the numbers in tables. |	1	participant | Key Facts/Explore Data Aug 2018 |
