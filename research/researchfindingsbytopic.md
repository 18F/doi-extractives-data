## Explore Data split
| Severity | Frequency |
| - | - |
| High | 30+ participants |

Studies: Home Page Sept 2018, Key Facts/Explore Data Aug 2018, Key Facts June 2018, Disbursements Round 1 May 2018, Inquisitive impala (unknown #), Randy Roo (unknown #), Splashy Sunfish (unknown #)

### Details

The current Explore Data page is unwieldy.  
- The map at the top doesn't orient users to what is on the page
- Download functionality is buried when users expect the two functions to be integrated
- Many users don't make it to the bottom or see all the sections because it's so long
- Many users get lost in the middle of the page
- Users don't get a good sense of what the sections (production, revenue, and disbursements) are about and how they relate to each other
