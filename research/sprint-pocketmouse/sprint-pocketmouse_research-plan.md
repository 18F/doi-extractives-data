# Sprint-PocketMouse research plan

## Goals / Questions
Goals | Questions
:----- | :---------
Evaluate global navigation | Do people understand the terms we've chosen for the global navigation?
 | What do people think they'll find if they click on those terms?
Evaluate glossary indicator | Do people understand what the glossary icon means?
Evaluate front page | Do people understand what the site is about?
Prioritize what to fix | What problems are most severe?


## Background

We are continuing to fine-tune the global navigation micro-copy on our site beased on the results from Sprint-MightyMoose research. Changes in this testing round include:

1. Changing 'local impact' to 'case studies' to more accurately reflect what's found under that link. Previously, people expected a much more robust set of content than we have for the December version of the site.

1. Creating two options for the glossary to test. One has an icon and looks like a tab, separate from the rest of the global nav. The other makes a 'utility' section of the global navigation that includes 'downloads' and 'glossary'.

More information on the proposed information architecture writ large is [here](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/issues/622).


### Metrics

* Whether participants understand what they'll find when they click on words in the global navigation
* Whether participants understand that we have a glossary of extraction terms.
* Whether participants understand what the USEITI is


## Methods
* 10 min interviews with people unfamiliar with USEITI
* Notes, no recording
* In-person and remote
