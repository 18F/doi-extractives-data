# Sprint-SarcasticSeacow research plan

## Goals

This round of research will have two prongs:

1. Begin usability testing the new state profile prototypes. We'll hope to find out:
    * Do users find it useful to see how much land is federally owned?
    * Do users understand how each map or visual is different?
    * Are users quicker to understand concepts like federal revenue?
    * Do users find the state pages more compelling?
2. Follow up with people who gave feedback at the USEITI outreach webinar on May 3rd to get more detail or ask further questions. These will be relatively unstructured conversations that help us inform our broader questions about framing and narrative. Questions may include:
    * How did you use the paper Executive Summary, and what did you find useful about it?
    * How have you navigated working with the data as an academic? What would make the data easier to use?
    * How do you see community groups or civil society groups using the site, and what would make it easier for them to use?

## Background

We've spent the last few sprints addressing some of the big issues raised by earlier research, including [confusion about revenues](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/issues/1260), [desire for more local stories/data](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/8_sprint-sarcasticseacow/sprint-sarcasticseacow_results.md#how-do-journalists-decide-if-something-is-interesting-and-worth-writing-about), [preferences for consolidated information about single states](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/8_sprint-sarcasticseacow/sprint-sarcasticseacow_results.md#how-do-people-want-to-use-our-data-what-were-they-trying-to-do-and-what-did-they-expect), and [the general need for data and context to be pulled together across the site](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/8_sprint-sarcasticseacow/sprint-sarcasticseacow_results.md#linking-related-information-and-data-across-the-site). Our hope is that the new state pages will solve many of these issues by providing a clearer, more focused narrative with links to relevant contextual information.

Also, ONRR held an outreach webinar in early May, and several attendees asked questions or offered feedback. Most of them work in or with civil society, which offers a chance to consider our "concerned citizen" persona. We'll be following up with them to gather more feedback and ask about how they've used the existing report/data.
