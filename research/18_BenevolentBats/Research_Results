# Study Goals

| Goals | Questions |
| :----- | :--------- |
| Determine whether we have addressed issues identified during last round of research. | Can users get to the specific data they want using any of the designs? |
| Determine the best approach to presenting disbursements data.| Are tables useful?|
| | Are filters useful? |
| | Are charts useful?|
| | Is commodity data useful?|
| | What do users like/donâ€™t like about a specific piece of a design?|
| | Do users want any of the other functions like download, email, and save?|

# Test Method 
Over the course of the sprint we interviewed individuals for 30-minute remote 1:1 sessions to have participants walk us through the prototypes for the design options and talk with them about how they would use each and their preference. Prototype: https://m13r6x.axshare.com/start_page.html

We alternated the order the designs were presented to avoid bias due to the order in which the prototypes are presented. After participants went through all 4 designs, we had them select their preferred option and probed into the functionality that they liked or didn't like across options.

# Participants

Since we already talked with target users prior to the design studio, we reached out to the participants from that study to see if we addressed their concerns and to other users in the participant pipeline (that had been previously identified). We aimed for 5-9 participants, both internal and external to DOI.
