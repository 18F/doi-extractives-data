# Research goal

The future of the United States’ participation in the EITI is currently in flux, so this research sprint was focused on hallway-testing a few versions of the homepage to help us choose a new name for the site that would help current and future users quickly orient to the site and understand what they could expect from it.

# Participants

We tested 3 different versions of the home screen with different combinations of words/phrases with *[???]* participants over the course of one week.

# Findings

## Option A: "U.S. Resources Revenue" 
*[image of option A]*


Upon first glance, several participants thought “U.S. Resources Revenue” was the name of an agency. This helped the site feel official, but did not help them understand what they could expect from the site.

The word “resources” doesn’t mean enough on its own:

> “What does ‘resources’ mean? That could be anything.”


## Option B: "Energy and minerals data explorer"

Several participants were distracted by calling the site an “explorer.”

However, many participants confirmed that “explore” works well as a call to action to begin exploring the data.

The phrase “energy & minerals” in the heading made it difficult for folks to conceptualize what the site was about.  

> “Hrm. I didn’t think about minerals. I wouldn’t think of oil, coal, and then... minerals? I am not as sure what this is about now.”

> “Is sunlight a type of energy we extract? Can I find out about solar here?”


“Federal land & waters” helped folks understand that the data covered was more than just land, but can be hard to conceptualize.

## Option C: "Natural resources revenue data"

“Natural resources” helped people conceptualize what the site was about better than “resources” alone.

## General observations

The graphic we introduced on all three homepage options of the oil rig with a dollar sign beneath it was polarizing for some of the folks we spoke to, but definitely helped participants grasp what the site was about.

# Conclusions

Based on these findings, we’re making the following design decisions for the first iteration of the new homepage:

We will be going with “Natural Resources Revenue Data” as the title/heading for our first iteration of the new language, given that most of our research participants found this heading clearest and most direct.

Despite causing some strong reactions, we plan to keep the oil rig graphic given its effectiveness in communicating what the site is about for most participants.

We plan to keep “lands and waters” somewhere in the subheadings or other explanatory text to help users conceptualize that much fo the extraction is happening offshore. We also plan to incorporate the word “energy” since this may improve the site’s Search Engine Optimization and findability, given that “energy” is a more common search term than “extractive.”
