# Background

Given that the purpose and content of the Natural Resources Revenue Data site is no longer going to be driven by the EITI, the ONRR team has an opportunity to revisit the purpose and goals of the site. We’d like to ground this potential shift in product strategy in a clear understanding of the needs of the site’s intended users.
