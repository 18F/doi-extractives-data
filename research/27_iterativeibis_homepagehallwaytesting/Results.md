# Results

We wanted to test these hypotheses in this study.
1. Taking the revenue trends outside of the tabs might be enough to fix the problems
  * FALSE:  Participants still thought the tabs either controlled the whole page or the trends to the right of the tabs and some were overwhelmed by the amount of the data on the homepage.

1. Separating Revenue, Production, Disbursements, and State into sections aides user understanding of the process.
 * TRUE: Participants had a much easier time understanding the process and were less overwhelmed and able to understand where to go to drill into the data.

1. Users need the button affordance to know that the toggles/tabs/buttons are clickable.
 * TRUE: Several participants didn't know that the cleaner toggles were clickable, initially and the buttons made it easier for them to understand how the page worked.

1. Trendlines work better on the right than the left.
 * POSSIBLY TRUE: 5/8 participants liked them better on the right for subjective reasons.  The two who liked them better on the left cited being able to see the context first before drilling in, which is only sort of what they actually convey.

1. We may be able to replace the revenue trendlines with a bar chart.
 * POSSIBLY TRUE: We need to do more research into this to know for sure.
