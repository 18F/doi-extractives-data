### Statistics site integration

Stakeholders: Judith Wilson, Greg Gould
Date: 11/29/17

### Background
Integrating the statistics.onrr.gov is a key goal of the revenuedata.doi.gov website. To ensure that the stats data integration is useful and useable, we want to know what is currently valuable.

### Goals
Understand what ONRR data is required for DOI employees to do their work and what their work entails. Also, what aspects of the statistics.onrr.gov site are valuable and where is there room for improvement 

### Questions
1. What do you do and what do you produce?
2. Do you use the statistics website (or other sites) in your work?
3. What aspects of the site work well, what do you struggle with?

### Methodology
A user interview will be held remotely with 5-10 participants. Each participant session will last no longer than 60 minutes and will include an interview and if possible a site tour of statistics.onrr.gov or other relevant sites.
