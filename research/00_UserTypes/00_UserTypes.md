### Goals 
* Inform people about natural resource revenue data that they know is available.
* Be a source of knowledge about natural resources revenue.
* Answer a question that either someone else is asking or they know they have.
* Provide the answer to the question in whatever format makes sense, whether it’s providing a number over the phone or creating their own charts.

### Pain Points

* Understanding the context for a number (i.e. is it fiscal, calendar or sales year)

### Scenarios
* A **congressional staffer** needs specific, accurate data on energy production and disbursements because they need to provide support for a proposed bill. They’re able to quickly and easily find data about how much energy was produced in their state and how much revenue their state got from energy production on federal land.
* Joe is an **external liaison for ONRR**.  He frequently fields questions from the public and congress for questions that could be answered on the site.  He looks in his databases for the answer to question first, but uses the site to verify the answer or for things he knows he can find more quickly on the site.

## User Type 2: Agenda Supporter

She wants to determine if oil production on federal lands has recently increased to help her interpret transportation-related risks to her state. She can easily find data that she trusts for oil production on federal lands. She can use that along with state production and export volumes, from other sources, to complete her analysis.

## User Type 3: Storyteller

* A **journalist** at a major regional news outlet is writing a story about policy claims about energy production on public land. They’re able to find data about production trends both at the national and regional/state level, which helps them back up their story with accurate numbers that haven’t been influenced by personal or political objectives.

## User Type 4: Domain Learner
We've interviewed 18 domain learners and 2 who find data as a domain learner, but uses the data like a storyteller.

He only has one week to generate a GoMESA disbursements data trend analysis to present to Gulf state elected officials. He’s able to find detailed, up-to-date GoMESA raw data to use as the basis of his analysis.
