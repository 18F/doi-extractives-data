# User Types
## Who we've interviewed
These are the types of users we've interviewed over the course of all studies since April 2018. 
![All users interviewed for disburemensts on a matrix](https://github.com/ONRR/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/00_UserTypes/AllUsers.PNG)

## User Type 1: Question Answerer
![Question answerer users on a matrix](https://github.com/ONRR/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/00_UserTypes/QuestionAnswerers.PNG)

### Goals 
* Answer a question that either someone else is asking or they know they have.
* Provide the answer to the question in whatever format makes sense, whether it’s providing a number over the phone or creating their own charts.
* Be a source of knowledge about natural resources revenue.
* Inform people about natural resource revenue data that they know is available.

### Pain Points
* Getting to a specific number
* Being able to easily share the found answer with the question asker
* Understanding terminology used on the site
* Understanding the context for a number (i.e. is it fiscal, calendar or sales year)

### Scenarios
* A **congressional staffer** needs specific, accurate data on oil royalties and disbursements because they need to provide support for a proposed bill. They’re able to quickly and easily find data about how much oil was produced on federal land in their state, how much royalty revenue was generated, and how much their state got.
* An **external liaison for ONRR** frequently fields questions from the public and congress for things that could be answered on the site, such as how much money the Gulf of Mexico generated from GOMESA. They look in databases for the answer to the question first, but use the site to verify the answer or for things they can point the question asker directly to on the site.
* A **BLM economist** uses our site to look up how much revenue and production companies had to verify whether North Dakota got the right amount of money (royalties) and who to audit. Looks at calendar year typically because every level they work with has a different fiscal year.


## User Type 2: Agenda Supporter
![Agenda supporter users on a matrix](https://github.com/ONRR/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/00_UserTypes/AgendaSupporters.PNG)
### Goals 
* Find supporting data for his or her agenda.
* Work with the data and use it to inform people about how natural resource revenue data supports their agenda.
* Revise the agenda based on the data found.
* Take action based on the agenda.

### Pain Points
* Understanding both the detail and how it lives within the context of the bigger picture
* Knowing they can trust the validity of the site and that the information is unbiased
* Knowing where to go next to find information that’s not on the site to follow a thread to related data
* Having to pull separate numbers in a spreadsheet to understand the whole picture
* Determining what to do when there is a discrepancy between multiple sources of information

### Scenarios
* A analyst for an **NGO** is concerned about increasing volumes of oil being transported by train through their state following a recent derailment. They want to determine if oil production on federal lands has recently increased to help interpret transportation-related risks to their state. The analyst can easily find data that they trust for oil production on federal lands to use that along with state production and export volumes, from other sources, to complete the analysis. They also want to be able to pinpoint specific companies that have production in the area around the derailment, so they can be held accountable.

## User Type 3: Storyteller
![Storyteller users on a matrix](https://github.com/ONRR/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/00_UserTypes/Storytellers.PNG)

### Goals 
* Understand what is happening with natural resources.
* Learn from the data whether there’s a story to tell and uncover any stories found.
* Flesh out the story with information from multiple sources.
* Tell the story to people in a compelling way.

### Pain Points
* Understanding both the detail and how it lives within the context of the bigger picture
* Knowing they can trust the validity of the site and that the information is unbiased
* Knowing where to go next to find information that’s not on the site to follow a thread to related data
* Understanding how the data ties to legislation
* Understanding how our data fits with other sources of data

### Scenarios
* A **professor of public policy** at a major university is writing an academic article focusing on how public land management balances recreation, energy production, and conservation priorities. They are able to locate federal production volumes and locations on the NRRD site and are able to use that data to inform their points in the article about federal government land-use policy.
* A **journalist** at a major regional news outlet is writing a story about policy claims about energy production on public land. They’re able to find data about production trends both at the national and regional/state level and how those numbers tie to policy, which helps them back up their story with accurate numbers that haven’t been influenced by personal or political objectives.

## User Type 4: Domain Learner
We've interviewed 18 domain learners and 2 who find data as a domain learner, but uses the data like a storyteller.

### Goals 
* Keep tabs on how well the process is working for the domain or locality he/she is interested in.
* Make decisions based on what he/she sees in the data.
* Answer questions pertaining to his or her domain and the process.

### Pain Points
* Seeing the information for the domain or locality that they’re interested in all in one place
* Understanding both the detail and how it lives within the context of the bigger picture
* Being able to see trends in the data over time
* Seeing information on the website without having to download the data
* Understanding where the data comes from

### Scenarios
* A new **county commissioner** in a western state with significant oil and gas production on federal land ran for office largely on a platform of government transparency and accountability and wants to know how extractive revenues from federal land are disbursed at the state and county level. Using the site, they are able to find out how much was disbursed to their county and state each month, which allows them to hold the state accountable, advocate for their constituents, and inform public debate about extractive industry in her county.
* A **leader of a tribal nation** is concerned about the layers of bureaucracy involved in tribal land governance and is working with the federal government to simplify the process for land-use authorization. They are able to find information on the tribal leasing process to inform their efforts.
* An analyst from **Intergovernmental Affairs in the Office of the Secretary** routinely pulls data to inform their interactions with Interior stakeholders. They have only one week to generate a GOMESA disbursements data trend analysis to present to Gulf state elected officials. They are able to find detailed, up-to-date GOMESA raw data to use as the basis of the analysis.
* A public affairs officer from an **oil company** uses our website to get numbers to use in press releases about their company’s extractive activities and to do comparisons against other companies.  They know the numbers are good to use because they come from a government site.
