# What we tested
## Goals
* Determine the best approach for presenting disbursements data on the website.
  * Can they find the data they want using the prototypes?
  * Can they understand the information in the prototypes?
  * Which approach works best?
* Determine how the users use the site as part of their overall task flows.
  * Where does the site fit into the user’s flow of work?
## Test Method
* 1 hour remote interviews
* Discussion of where the portal fits into their process
* Task-based testing of live site and prototypes 
  * Prototypes: https://m13r6x.axshare.com/start_1.html
  * We alternated the order the designs were presented to avoid bias due to the order in which the prototypes are presented. After participants went through all designs, we had them select their preferred option and probed into the functionality that they liked or didn't like across options.
# Who we interviewed
We interviewed 4 storytellers, 2 question answerers, 1 agenda supporter, and 1 domain learner.

# Findings summary
Determine the best approach for presenting disbursements data on the website.
* Users liked the added ability to **slice and dice** the data to get to the information they want.  They also liked the added detail of commodity and monthly data because it allows more slicing and dicing.
* Horizontal bar charts won for the **summary display**, by a long shot.
* The single **table** allows users to compare in ways that they can’t with the split tables and that seems to be important to users.
* Users want an easy way to get **explanations** about where the data came from and what it means.
* Participants said they liked **charts**, in theory, but then said it would depend on whether they actually match their question, so they should be secondary. 
* Participants had issues **navigating** the current site, particularly using search and the offshore region page.
Determine how the users use the site as part of their overall task flows.
* We know a lot about Question Answerers and Storytellers, but need to learn more about Domain Learners and Agenda Supporters.
# Slicing and dicing
User impact: High
* All of the participants mentioned that they liked how the new designs allow them to filter and drill down into the data to get to the data they want and they were able to get to the information much more quickly than they were using the live site.
* Several mentioned having detailed data would allow them to do more slicing and dicing.  In particular, they were interested in
  * Year over year trends (6)
  * Commodity (4)
  * Calendar/fiscal/sales year (4)
  * Onshore/offshore (3)
  * Monthly (2)
  * Flaring & venting (1)
  * Royalty relief (1)
  * Sales value (1)
  * More totals (1) 
  
Recommendation: Determine what we can reasonably add to the site.
# Summary display
User impact: High
We showed 5 options for summary displays for federal and 3 for state.

[Fed A](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/fed_1a.html)
[Fed B](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/fed_1b.html)
[Fed C](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/fed_1c.html)
[Fed D](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/fed_1d.html)
[Fed E](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/fed_1e.html)

[State A](https://m13r6x.axshare.com/state_a.html)

## Summary display ratings
I took all of the reactions from participants and created a score for each design.
Favorite: +2, Positive: +1, Neutral: 0, Negative: -1

| Design | Fed | State | Notes |
| ------ | --- | ----- | ----- |
Vertical Bar Graphs (Fed A, State A) | 0 | -1 | People who liked this, liked the trend over time, but some found it lacking in explanations or didn’t like that you couldn’t compare the graphs with each other.  On the state side, people were confused that not all the graphs added up to a total. |
Horizontal Bar Graphs (Fed B, State B) | 11 | 7 | People thought this best explained what was going on. |
Cards with Words (Fed C) | 0 | N/A | Many thought this was too text heavy. |
Cards with Charts (Fed D) | 0 | N/A | Some people liked this, but many thought it was confusing to mix chart types. |
Table (Fed E, State C) | 4 | 0 | Many thought the table was straightforward, but lacked visual appeal.  Some were confused when the table format changed after clicking down a level. |

Recommendation: Use the horizontal bar graphs.
