# What we tested
## Goals
* Determine the best approach for presenting disbursements data on the website.
  * Can they find the data they want using the prototypes?
  * Can they understand the information in the prototypes?
  * Which approach works best?
* Determine how the users use the site as part of their overall task flows.
  * Where does the site fit into the userâ€™s flow of work?
## Test Method
* 1 hour remote interviews
* Discussion of where the portal fits into their process
* Task-based testing of live site and prototypes 
  * Prototypes: https://m13r6x.axshare.com/start_1.html
  * We alternated the order the designs were presented to avoid bias due to the order in which the prototypes are presented. After participants went through all designs, we had them select their preferred option and probed into the functionality that they liked or didn't like across options.
