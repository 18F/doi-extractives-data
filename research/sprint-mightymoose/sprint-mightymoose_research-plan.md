# Information architecture research plan

## Goals / Questions
Goals | Questions
:----- | :---------
Evaluate global navigation | Do people understand the terms we've chosen for the global navigation?
 | What do people think they'll find if they click on those terms?
Evaluate front page | Do people understand what the site is about?
 | We've starting moving towards global nav as categories throughout the site. Is this making the information structure clearer?
Prioritize what to fix | What problems are most severe?


## Background

After a development pause to wait for multi-stakeholder group decisions on content and available datasets, the team is back in full-time business to continue site work. With this additional information about content and data, we have re-thought the site information architecture and have proposed changes to test.

More information on the proposed information architecture is [here](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/issues/622).


### Metrics

* Whether participants understand what they'll find when they click on words in the global navigation
* Whether participants understand what the USEITI is


## Methods
* 5-10 min interviews with GSA-ers and citizens of Tucson, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and St. Germain, Wisconsin.
* Notes, no recording
* In-person and remote
