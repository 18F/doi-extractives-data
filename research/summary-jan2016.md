# Research summary, January 2016

## Problem Statement from March 2015

The USEITI website was intended to meet these goals:
- increase transparency and dialogue about the U.S. natural resource revenues system
- increase trust and dialogue between natural resource sectors (industry, civil society and government)
- meet the requirements of the international EITI standard in a modern (read: online) way

We have observed that the USEITI website isn’t:
- meeting the contextual requirements of the international EITI standard
- explaining the relationship of EITI/USEITI, stakeholders, extractive revenues (leading to a ‘...this is cool, but what is it?’)
- engaging audiences, and therefore is not inspiring dialogue

which is causing these adverse effects:
- our project is at risk of being irrelevant (not reaching target audiences)
- USEITI may revert to a paper EITI Report if EITI requirements cannot be met online

measurable criteria for success:
- USEITI 2015 Report is delivered as a wholly online experience with only a short executive summary PDF
- website views increase
- our site becomes a generally-accepted source of information on this sector
- congressional staffers call us or use our site’s information on this sector
- both civil society and industry use our site

## Status of our measurable criteria, January 2016

### USEITI 2015 Report is delivered as a wholly online experience with only a short executive summary PDF

We were able to deliver the first version of the USEITI report online. We are not in danger of not meeting the contextual narrative requirements of the international EITI standard and in fact likely have much more information than is required. Our executive summary is longer than we would have liked, but we expect now that a website exists, multi-stakeholder group participants will feel more comfortable making the executive summary a true executive summary in the future because they can see the breadth of what is available online.

Recommend removing this metric and related hypotheses from focus because it is not anywhere near the most severe of our challenges anymore. Truly, however, it can't be completely retired until international EITI officially approves the USEITI Report in 2016.

### Website views increase

We now have a launched website to baseline this metric against.

### Our site becomes a generally-accepted source of information on this sector; congressional staffers call us or use our site’s information on this sector; both civil society and industry use our site

We have not made progress against these metrics yet, though we now have a live website to publicize (yay!). USEITI did not do a huge amount of outreach and publicity with the first launch. There was some, but a concerted outreach and feedback method is needed to (eventually) test these metrics. We will continue working with their related hypotheses in 2016.
