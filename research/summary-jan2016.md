# Research summary
*January 2016*

## Problem Statement from March 2015

The USEITI website was intended to meet these goals:
- increase transparency and dialogue about the U.S. natural resource revenues system
- increase trust and dialogue between natural resource sectors (industry, civil society and government)
- meet the requirements of the international EITI standard in a modern (read: online) way

We have observed that the USEITI website isn’t:
- meeting the contextual requirements of the international EITI standard
- explaining the relationship of EITI/USEITI, stakeholders, extractive revenues (leading to a ‘...this is cool, but what is it?’)
- engaging audiences, and therefore is not inspiring dialogue

which is causing these adverse effects:
- our project is at risk of being irrelevant (not reaching target audiences)
- USEITI may revert to a paper EITI Report if EITI requirements cannot be met online

measurable criteria for success:
- USEITI 2015 Report is delivered as a wholly online experience with only a short executive summary PDF
- website views increase
- our site becomes a generally-accepted source of information on this sector
- congressional staffers call us or use our site’s information on this sector
- both civil society and industry use our site

## Status of our measurable criteria, January 2016

### USEITI 2015 Report is delivered as a wholly online experience with only a short executive summary PDF

We were able to deliver the first version of the USEITI report online. We are not in danger of not meeting the contextual narrative requirements of the international EITI standard and in fact likely have much more information than is required. Our executive summary is longer than we would have liked, but we expect now that a website exists, multi-stakeholder group participants will feel more comfortable making the executive summary a true executive summary in the future because they can see the breadth of what is available online.

One of the remaining sticky wickets to international EITI approval of the USEITI report is around reconciliation data. The international EITI requirements in this area are hard to apply in the US context, both technically and politically. On top of that, the process is complicated and hard to explain (which makes for a confusing website).

For 2016, we should replace this metric and related hypotheses with one that deals with reconciliation content specifically. And truly, this metric can't be completely retired until international EITI officially approves the USEITI Report in 2016.

### Website views increase

We now have a launched website to baseline this metric against.

### Our site becomes a generally-accepted source of information on this sector; congressional staffers call us or use our site’s information on this sector; both civil society and industry use our site

We have not made progress against these metrics yet, though we now have a live website to publicize (yay!). We will continue working with this in 2016.

## Suggested revisions to problem statement for January 2016

The USEITI website was intended to meet these goals:
- increase transparency and dialogue about the U.S. natural resource revenues system
- increase trust and dialogue between natural resource sectors (industry, civil society and government)
- meet the requirements of the international EITI standard in a modern (read: online) way

We have observed that the USEITI website isn’t:
- engaging audiences, and therefore is not inspiring dialogue
- explaining and providing information about the EITI reconciliation requirement in a way that is both understandable to a non-specialist audience and meets the EITI standard.

which is causing these adverse effects:
- our project is at risk of being irrelevant (not reaching target audiences)
- our project is at risk of either not being approved, or not reaching target audiences because in order to meet international EITI requirements we made content too complex

measurable criteria for success:
- website views increase
- our site becomes a generally-accepted source of information on this sector
- congressional staffers call us or use our site’s information on this sector
- both civil society and industry use our site
- the USEITI Report is approved by international EITI
- non-specialists can get what they need from our site and not be turned away by complex content about the EITI process (ie, reconciliation)

## What do we know from our previous research about our project goals?

###  How do people feel about transparency and dialogue in the U.S. natural resource revenues system?

We don't know much about this yet. We do know that people tend to come from a place of mistrust. They often want to find out who is sponsoring the site:

- _I always look for the owner._

- _Who are they [USEITI]?_

- _I still want to understand why this [site and initiative] exists._

- _This looks like an industry site._

- _[I expect that the site might] highlight the positive and leave out the negative._

There is some understanding that the site exists to provide access to information that was previously inaccessible. Note, again, that the assumption tends to be that something was incorrect or not shared or previously inadequate, and therefore this initiative was created now.

- _The site is for the public, to give them access to info that isn't easily accessible._

- _The government is trying to figure out what industry is doing with natural resources._

- _Primarily for lobbyists or people in industry to evaluate data available in one place, condensed information._

In terms of dialogue, we didn't get much information that directly related to how people interact with policy. However, when people thought about engaging with the subject area, they expected the ability to contact local officials.

- _Information about talking with local officials somewhere?_

We have a very interesting research problem in our future. The site is about a fairly complex policy area that people should be able to contribute to, but currently is too complicated for non-specialists to easily engage with. Our first version of the site attempts to make information about the policy area easier to understand, but the question still remains: what is the best way to promote dialogue in this area? How do people wish to be engaged? This problem (complexity plus public engagement without intense time commitment or specialist background) is common to many areas of public policy. The research we do here will hopefully be of use to other projects as well.

### How is trust and dialogue between natural resource sectors going? (industry, civil society and government)

Our previous research didn't reveal anything about this desired outcome.

### Are we meeting the requirements of the international EITI standard in a modern (read: online) way?

In terms of research, the challenge here is that some of the requirements of the international EITI standard are very technical. Even the name of the initiative itself is confusing to non-specialists. We will continue to attempt to strike a balance between EITI requirements and user needs. Also, we have revised the metrics associated with this outcome (see above) to reflect the learnings from the past year.
