# Sprint-RandyRoo research results

## Hypotheses tested

This was our first major round of research that focused on the new state profile pages. We developed the state profiles to target this hypothesis:

> We believe that: Connecting data within the site better, especially production and revenue...
> Will result in enriched conversations about policy and clearing up misconceptions.

We also hoped to address feedback from prior usability tests, including confusion about revenues and interest in local/state stories.

## Participants

* 4 people who live in (or are from) states with significant extractive activity. We talked people from 4 MSG priority states: West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Alaska.
* Each person we talked to had relatively high digital literacy and/or moderate subject-matter knowledge: one works on another open data project at 18F, one is a journalist, one is an active concerned citizen, and one works for a nonprofit that partners with federal land management agencies.

## Methodology

We showed each participant the state profile page for their state, and asked them to navigate the page and familiarize themselves with the information while thinking out loud.

## Findings

### Overall findings

With this round of usability testing, we saw a major sea change in how users reacted to the site. Here's what we noticed:

* Testers understood the scope and context much more quickly, and clearly enough that they could begin critiquing both the higher-level context of EITI and the details of UI elements.
* Testers engaged with the data itself, and asked real questions about states, industries, and context.
* Testers _did not_ get lost in filters or go down dead-ends, because that's not possible anymore.
* Testers did not get as confused (i.e. about revenue), and when they did, they were often able to correct themselves in the course of browsing the page (without prompting or intervention).

### Specific feedback

Maps (general):

- Bothered by the tilt of West Virginia (very used to seeing their state a certain way)

Federal land ownership:

- Wants to know how state land ownership stats compare nationally
- The phrase "much like they would to any land owner" is very clear
- Because the federal land percentage was the first thing visible, one user expressed confusion about whether the entire scope of the page would be limited to federal land: "Is this all about the natural resources that are on federal land?" [Scrolls down to revenue almost immediately] "Whoa! With so much gas extraction going on in our state, and if this just reports on what’s being done on federal land, that’s alarming!
- "What might be helpful is a little intro, like, on this site we’ll talk about the extractive industries on federal land, state land, private land, because otherwise people will see this federal land thing and think this isn’t relevant to me."
- "People in PA...if they just see these specs of federal land at the top they’re gonna go, eeeeh this isn’t that interesting."

Revenue introduction:

- "I like that you define revenue here — this is so well written!"
- Two people wondered what year the revenue chart data is from
- Revenue chart: "This is an interesting and good way to show the phases of owning land and getting money — but I’m confused as to what the whole represents" (what the bars are adding up to; expected them to add up horizontally to the commodity totals)
- One user toggled repeatedly between the numbers and the explanations; might have been easier to see them side-by-side
- Still some confusion about what the process phases mean and how to understand these numbers:
    - "What! That’s bullshit" (looking at rent amounts)..."okay, I guess if we’re getting royalties that’s less bad...is that the tax rate, though?"
    - "What does _Bonus_ mean?" (Definition doesn’t seem to make sense related to word)
    - "It's not exactly breaking it down, but maybe I’m not familiar with it."
- Likely don't need to repeat federal land percentage ("Okay, you said that before")

Revenue by commodity:

- The definition of revenue got lost: "This feels like a small amount of taxes"
- Confused by the dot denoting the highlighted year: "What is this dot?...Why does the most recent year matter that much more than other years?"
- Interested in state tax revenue as well as federal ("Two weeks ago we had a budget crisis and the state almost shut down because of declining tax revenue from coal.")
- Several users clicked on and explored the links under "State revenue"
    + …"revenue from state land, okay...we don’t have detailed data, that’s not good" [goes to state regulations, starts exploring PA state details almost immediately]
    + "I know it’s gonna be a heckuva lot, but there’s a debate going on in PA about impact fees and extraction taxes...I know other states have that sometimes, so you might want to pull that in across the site."
    + "Why is the federal government providing so much information about the state laws and regulations? Maybe [I wonder] because Alaska is so divided. Why is there this interest? Is it because there is this oversight?"
    + "When I saw that link [back on state page] I expected it to take me to a state site. I don’t think I would have read this paragraph" [on the state legal fiscal page]

- "Might be nice to have a map that’s color coded according to the extractive material, i.e. oil or gas or coal, compared with federal land or state land or private land."
- One user opened quite a few details charts and got disoriented: "I think once I had all these [details] open I think I got lost. But now that I closed them it makes sense."
- Oil/gas confusion here: "I see gas and oil, but I guess I’m not clear why there is oil and gas (non-royalty), but what about royalty o and g? Is that somewhere else on that page that I missed. Was I not reading carefully, or was that not here?"


Production:

- Initially confused by similarity to prior section: "How is this different from the above? Oh, is this ALL of Texas not just federal land? But I thought you just said we don’t have data because…" (took some time to  notice that the units were not money anymore)
- Some terms were unclear: "Biomass — what’s biomass?" "What’s Other Biomass?"
- Likes breakdown by industry
- Wants more context for renewables data ("this is going to be a huge conversation here")
- "West Virginia is in a transition period in terms of extraction"
- Wanted more data about production on state land: "This whole thing about natural resource production on state land...that would be good to get — that’s a hot issue around here. And private land, that would be helpful."

Federal production:

- Several testers tried to click on county maps
- Units need definitions:
    + "I wanna know what mcf is"
    + "I need a key"
    + "What’s BBL?"
    + "I wonder if there could be an explanation for these words (mcf, bbl)"

Jobs:

- People really gravitated to this section: "I wanted to get to the employment section. I was thinking that it would tell me how many jobs there are in alaska. What percentage of alaskans are emplyed by the extractive industries and that’s there. That’s great!"
- Wanted to be able to sort this table by # or %
- Several testers had existing perceptions about extractives employment, and were looking at this section to validate those perceptions:
    + "I would expect it [jobs in oil] to be more"... "I wonder what percent of the economy, or what percent of income comes from oil."
    + "Is this just jobs that are in the production itself, or does this include related jobs, like hotel and restaurant jobs. It would be useful to clarify whether this is just oil and gas themselves, or all the other industries." [looks for her county]
- They tended to look to counties or regions they know: "I’d be curious about parts of the state that I’m familiar with, and where those parts are people who are physically drilling for employment vs. execs in Dallas...and if we stopped drilling more, would those people have options."

GDP:

- This section seemed to provide the best overall context and validate testers' perceptions of extractive industries' role in their states' economies:
    + "Oh! Okay! That’s the economy — so it **is** higher!"
    + "Wow, 28.7% of the GDP!"
- Interest in further granularity: "I’d probably be curious about how much of a role oil and gas played in the overall economy, compared to other types of energy."
- Wants to see further explanation about the years and most recent datasets: "I would want to know how soon the 2014, 2015 nujmbers can be available and an explanation of when they could be available. Most people understand why you don’t get them right away. Point out that it isn’t outdated, but why"

Exports:

- "But you were talking about Natural Gas up here...are gas and natural gas the same thing?"

Disbursements [minimal content]:

- Disbursements is an unfamiliar word, and people weren't sure what it meant: "What’s a disbursement? Why are they getting money? Aren’t they making money?"
- "I’m assuming this is like grants to oil companies or something."

Overall UI notes:

- "I’m used to there being a DOI logo. I partner with them and they are really insistent that there logo has to be on everything."
- Sparkline labels were unclear:
    + "Are these months of the year? I don’t know why it’s 6 through 15"
    + "It isn’t clear [what the year markers in the line chart in employment] are. 7, 8, 9?"
- Dramatic trends could be misleading:
    + "The ups and downs seem really dramatic in the graph. In 2013 it was so hight, but in 2014 it plummeted. But then I go to the chart, and realize you are just taking a snippet, so it didn't plummet."
    + Noted that natural gas and oil production is "skyrocketing"

### Overall positive feedback

- "I could definitely see a use for this"
- "I think you guys are really right on the right track."
- "If I was trying to get a sense — like for a school report (there’s a whole lot of Texas history taught in Texas, so I could definitely imagine needing to find info about this) — I would have a pretty easy job; I could sort my way through."
- "The graphics are so clear, it is hard to focus on the design because I want to just look at all the numbers."
- "I’m really excited that this info is available in this way."
