# Sprint-HautyHagfish research plan


## Goals
For this round of research, we're zooming back out to a more general level of inquiry. We want insight into how people feel about transparency and dialogue in the U.S. natural resource revenues system. We will be conducting interviews with participants in the states and counties that USEITI has identified as focus areas.


## Background

We moved from broad research to usability testing in the last quarter (in particular around global navigation and information architecture) so that we'd have a usable and useful version one launch in December 2015. Now that we have a live site to test, we're going to zoom out again and do research on user needs and whether or not our site is addressing those needs, and think about what features to prioritize in the future.

With the first launch, we think we've met some of the outcomes we hoped to achieve. For example, see our [January 2016 research summary](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/summary-jan2016.md) that discusses our March 2015 problem statement, its metrics, and where we stand in January 2016. We've updated our problem statement to adjust those metrics and statements to help us focus on our remaining challenges. This leaves us with the following work:

The USEITI website was intended to meet these goals:
- increase transparency and dialogue about the U.S. natural resource revenues system
- increase trust and dialogue between natural resource sectors (industry, civil society and government)
- meet the requirements of the international EITI standard in a modern (read: online) way

We have observed that the USEITI website isn’t:
- engaging audiences, and therefore is not inspiring dialogue
- explaining and providing information about the EITI reconciliation requirement in a way that is both understandable to a non-specialist audience and meets the EITI standard.

which is causing these adverse effects:
- our project is at risk of being irrelevant (not reaching target audiences)
- our project is at risk of either not being approved, or not reaching target audiences because in order to meet international EITI requirements we made content too complex

measurable criteria for success:
- website views increase
- our site becomes a generally-accepted source of information on this sector
- congressional staffers call us or use our site’s information on this sector
- both civil society and industry use our site
- the USEITI Report is approved by international EITI
- non-specialists can get what they need from our site and not be turned away by complex content about the EITI process (ie, reconciliation)
