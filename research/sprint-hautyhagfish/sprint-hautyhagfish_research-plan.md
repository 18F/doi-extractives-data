# Sprint-HautyHagfish research plan

**This is a work in progress, and at the moment is copied from an earlier plan. Do not use yet.**

## Goals / Questions
Goals | Questions
:----- | :---------
Evaluate front page | Do people understand what the site is about?
 | Can they figure out how to find and navigate stories?
Test terms | Do people understand the term 'extractive resources'?
Prioritize what to fix | What problems are most severe?


## Background

We moved from broad research to usability testing in the last quarter, in particular around global navigation and information architecture, so that we'd have a usable and useful version one launch in December 2015. Now that we have a live site to test, we're going to zoom out again and do research on user needs and whether or not our site is addressing those needs, and think about what features to prioritize in the future.

With the first launch, we think we've met some of the outcomes we hoped to achieve. For example, see our [January 2016 research summary](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/summary-jan2016.md) that discusses our March 2015 problem statement, its metrics, and where we stand in January 2016. We've updated our problem statement to remove those metrics and statements we think we've achieved to help us focus on our remaining challenges. This leaves us with the following work:

The USEITI website was intended to meet these goals:
- increase transparency and dialogue about the U.S. natural resource revenues system
- increase trust and dialogue between natural resource sectors (industry, civil society and government)
- meet the requirements of the international EITI standard in a modern (read: online) way

We have observed that the USEITI website isn’t:
- engaging audiences, and therefore is not inspiring dialogue

which is causing these adverse effects:
- our project is at risk of being irrelevant (not reaching target audiences)

Measurable criteria for success:
- website views increase
- our site becomes a generally-accepted source of information on this sector
- congressional staffers call us or use our site’s information on this sector
- both civil society and industry use our site


### Metrics

* Whether participants understand what they'll find when they click on words in the global navigation
* Whether participants understand that click on an underlined word with a book icon means that we have a glossary of extraction terms that they can access.
* Whether participants understand what the USEITI is


## Methods
* 10 min interviews with people unfamiliar with USEITI
* Notes, no recording
* In-person and remote


## Script

Script available [here](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/sprint-pocketmouse/sprint-pocketmouse_interview-script.md).


## Test asset(s)

We have two versions of this test, one with a simpler glossary icon (open book) and one with a slightly more complex icon (open book with bookmark). We will start testing with the simpler icon, but if that is not clear, move to the more complex icon.
