<h3><a name="intro" class="communities_content-heading js-comm_section">Introduction</a></h3>

While extractive industries make up 2.6% of 2013 US GDP, they play a much larger role in some local communities. For example, extractive industries make up more than a third of the State of Wyoming’s GDP.[^1] At the county level, certain communities and local economies may be even more dependent on extractive industries.

This section includes 12 case studies that provide a snapshot into communities that, over the last decade, have led U.S. counties in producing oil, gas, coal, gold, iron, or copper. These counties, or in some cases clusters of counties given geological formations, were selected based on their high levels of production. We hope these case studies will help you understand the economic and fiscal effects of oil, gas, and mineral extraction on local communities, including revenue sustainability.

### Choose a community to get started

<ul class="communities_content-select">
  <li>Gas: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/case-studies/tar">Tarrant &amp; Johnson Counties, Texas</a></li>
  <li>Oil: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/case-studies/nor">North Slope Borough, Alaska</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="reven" class="communities_content-heading js-comm_section">Revenue sustainability</a></h3>

Local governments and communities must consider the many ways natural resource management and extraction can affect their fiscal health. One of the most significant considerations is the sustainability of the revenues local governments receive due to natural resource extraction. Multiple EITI guiding principles reference revenue sustainability as a critical factor in making natural resource wealth &ldquo;an engine for sustainable economic growth.&rdquo;[^2] However, when it comes to managing this critical factor, there are two challenges localities need to address:

<ol class="decimal list-para">
  <li>The sustainability of revenue over time, given that revenue fluctuates with commodity prices, and fossil fuels and hardrock mineral deposits are finite or may not be economically extractable based on current technology.</li>
  <li>The net sustainability of revenue given the fiscal benefits of increased revenue from extractive activities and the fiscal costs of increased government expenditures necessary to support extractive activities.
  </li>
</ol>

These revenue sustainability considerations are magnified at the local level in the United States: A significant influx or loss of natural resource revenue can have a material impact, both positive and negative, on the quality and variety of services that a local government can provide its residents. Therefore, to achieve sustainable economic prosperity, local governments must consider how they can best use natural resource revenue to promote long-term growth and investment in their communities, and how to ensure that the financial benefits of extraction outweigh the costs in the short- and long-term.

<h3 ><a name="county-rev" class="communities_content-heading js-comm_section">Revenue</a></h3>

At the county level, revenue received from extractive activities takes many forms. For example, some payments originate from taxes on land ownership, while others are based on ownership of the natural resource itself. There are also different methods of valuation ranging from payments at the point-of-sale, to annual taxes, to those based on an estimated value of the natural resource. The four most common types of revenue examined include: property taxes, sales and use taxes, state transfer payments, and additional production taxes.

* **Property taxes/ad valorem.** Taxes paid by owners of oil and gas or mineral properties to the county government based on the value of the property.
* **Sales and use taxes.** Though not a direct result of natural resource extraction, revenue from sales and use taxes can rise dramatically during resource extraction booms when population and economic activity increase.
* **State transfer payments.** Revenue transferred to the county by the state that comes from sources such as **severance taxes** paid by extractives industries to the state based on the volume or value of the resources extracted, and **lease payments**, such as bonuses, rents, and royalties, paid by the extractive industries to a public land and mineral owner, either the federal government or the state.
* **County production taxes.** Severance taxes or other payments paid by extractive industries to the county based on the volume or value of resources extracted, or per lease terms if the county is the landowner.

<h3><a name="county-cos" class="communities_content-heading js-comm_section">Costs</a></h3>

More often than not, local governments must also make financial investments in their communities to support the extractive industries. These can vary based on the size of the community, the state of its current infrastructure, and the type of natural resources extracted (e.g., coal mining versus natural gas drilling). In some circumstances, these costs are outweighed by the influx of revenue, while in other cases costs can result in net negative fiscal effects on local governments.[^3] Given these possibilities and considerations, these case studies focus on four types of fiscal costs at the local level:

* **Transportation.** The cost of constructing new transportation infrastructure (e.g., roads or trains) or repairing current infrastructure due to heavy industry use.
* **Water** The cost of constructing new water or sewer infrastructure (e.g., water pipelines, treatment plants) to meet the needs of extractive industries, upgrading current infrastructure, or treating additional wastewater from extractive activities in the public wastewater treatment system.
* **Reclamation.** The cost of returning mines or oil and gas lands to their state prior to disturbance, including physical site stability and ecosystem functions, and long-term site monitoring. (Today’s companies are legally responsible for current reclamation costs and pay SMCRA fees towards historic abandoned mines.)
* **Emergency Services.** The cost of new emergency services (e.g., firehouses, ambulances, chemical spill equipment) needed to support extractive industries and protect the public from possible health and safety hazards.

There are additional fiscal benefits and burdens associated with extractive activities beyond those addressed here. For example, a local government may receive in-kind revenue from extractive industries, such as payment for a new public road that company employees will use to access work sites. Another fiscal cost may be the additional government staff needed to manage public services required to support extractive activities. While all are worthy of careful consideration by local communities and governments, these case studies focuse on the revenue and costs defined above.

<h3><a name="data" class="communities_content-heading js-comm_section">Data</a></h3>

We used a range of publicly available online information to compile the case studies, including government databases, documents, and reports, and online information produced by councils of governments. The case studies integrate data and analysis already reported elsewhere by government bodies. Local data sources were prioritized, and data was collected and presented at the most granular level available. State information took the place of county information when the latter was not available.

County and state budget documents and state agency websites were the primary data sources. Federal agency websites and reports also provided critical information on employment in extractive industries, proved reserves of various natural resources, and production estimates.

This year’s data collection process was the first step in bringing information about extractive industries’ impacts on local communities and governments to the public in a clear, digestible way. We reached out to each county we profiled to communicate the purpose and status of the USEITI, verify content, and lay the foundation for future collaboration.
