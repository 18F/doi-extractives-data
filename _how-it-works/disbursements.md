Companies pay {{ "bonuses" | term:"bonus" }}, rents, and royalties to extract natural resources on federal lands and waters. The result is revenue collected by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR). ONRR then disburses that revenue according to [federal laws and regulations]({{site.baseurl}}/how-it-works/federal-laws/). These laws and regulations govern how, when, and to whom disbursements are paid.

## Disbursement recipients

ONRR disburses revenue to six main funds, recipients, or groups:

- **U.S. Treasury**: The federal governmentâ€™s basic operating fund pays for roughly two-thirds of all federal expenditures, including the military, national parks, and schools.

- **State and local governments**: Funds disbursed to states fall under the jurisdiction of each state, and each state determines how the funds will be used.

- **Reclamation Fund**: Supports the establishment of critical infrastructure projects like dams and power plants.

- **Native American tribes and individuals**: ONRR disburses 100% of revenue collected from resource extraction on Native American lands back to tribes, nations, and individuals.

- **Land and Water Conservation Fund**: Provides matching grants to states and local governments to buy and develop public outdoor recreation areas across the 50 states. [How this fund works]({{site.baseurl}}/how-it-works/land-and-water-conservation-fund/)

- **Historic Preservation Fund**: Helps preserve U.S. historical and archaeological sites and cultural heritage through grants to state and tribal historic preservation offices. [How this fund works]({{site.baseurl}}/how-it-works/historic-preservation-fund/)

A portion of funds goes back to federal land management agencies to help cover operational costs or special projects. These disbursements show up in the data as "Other funds". 

We share [disbursements data for each fund by fiscal year]({{site.baseurl}}/explore/#by-fund).

## Disbursements and location

### Onshore and offshore

The distribution of disbursements often depends on where the revenue was generated. The largest geographic categories that govern disbursements are _onshore_ and _offshore_. For example, state governments receive a portion of revenue from onshore extraction on federal land in their state, and 100% of disbursements to the Reclamation Fund come from onshore revenues. 

### Disbursements from offshore revenues

Most offshore areas are under the jurisdiction of the federal government, so offshore revenues make up the majority of disbursements to the U.S. Treasury. The Land and Water Conservation Fund and Historic Preservation Fund receive disbursements exclusively from offshore revenues.

A portion of revenue generated from offshore leases within three miles of a given state's shoreline is shared with that state. This three-mile region is called the {{ "8(g)" | term }} zone.

Most offshore revenue comes from oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. The [Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA)]({{site.baseurl}}/how-it-works/gomesa/) of 2006 requires a portion of that revenue be shared with four states that border the Gulf of Mexico: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. 

### Native American disbursements

ONRR disburses 100% of revenue collected from resource extraction on Native American lands back to tribes, nations, and individuals. [Learn more about natural resources on Native American land]({{site.baseurl}}/how-it-works/#tribal-overview).

## Matching revenue and disbursement totals

The timing and frequency of disbursement payments depend on the laws and regulations that govern the disbursement.

ONRR disburses some revenues the same month they are received, others at the end of the fiscal year, and some the following fiscal year. Because some disbursements are paid out the following fiscal year, the revenue and disbursement totals for a given fiscal year may not match up.
