Companies pay bonuses, rents, and royalties to extract natural resources on federal lands and waters. This results in revenue collected by the Office of Natural Resources Reevenue (ONRR). ONRR then disburses that revenue according to [federal laws and regulations]({{site.baseurl}}/how-it-works/federal-laws/) passed by Congress. These laws and regulations govern the {{ "authorization" | term: "authorization" }} of disbursement payments to certain funds, state and local governments, or the U.S. Treasury.
