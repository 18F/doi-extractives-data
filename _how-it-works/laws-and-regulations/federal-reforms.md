  <h1>Federal reforms</h1>
  
  <p>The federal government reforms laws and regulations by enacting new legislation and proposing new rules to implement the legislation. Reforms can stem from government oversight organizations’ recommendations, including from both DOI’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the US Government Accountability Office (GAO). Below are lists of reforms following the Deep Water Horizon oil spill, recent findings from government oversight organizations, and proposed rules.</p>
  
  <h3>Regulatory reforms following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill</h3>
  
  <p>Reforms to federal regulations occurred in the aftermath of the Deep Water Horizon Oil Spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The federal government overhauled the oversight of DOI’s leasing, regulation, and collection of revenue for oil and gas extraction on the Outer Continental Shelf. DOI’s post Deepwater Horizon reorganization separated and established independent oversight for offshore leasing (i.e., BOEM), offshore safety and environmental enforcement (i.e., BSEE), and the collection and accountability of the revenue generated from natural resource development on federal and Indian lands through the creation of the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (i.e., ONRR). When the Secretary of the Interior announced the creation of ONRR in May 2010 and the elimination of the former Minerals Management Service in June 2010, the goal was to fundamentally restructure the government’s mineral leasing, regulatory, and revenue collection agencies. The Secretary wanted to:</p>
  
  <ul class="list-bullet">
	<li>Separate the three responsibilities (leasing, regulation, and revenue collection)</li>
	<li>Provide each office and bureau with the independence and resources necessary to fulfill their missions</li>
	<li>Eliminate real and perceived conflicts associated with the previous organizations</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>While the federal government did make regulatory reforms following the spill, Congress did not change any laws related to offshore fossil fuel management in response to the accident.</p>

  <h3>Office of Inspector General reports</h3>
  
  <p>DOI’s OIG is responsible for the independent oversight and promotion of excellence, integrity, and accountability within the programs, operations, and management of DOI. OIG also identifies and prevents fraud, waste, and mismanagement within the agency. In recent years, OIG has published numerous reports related to DOI revenue from natural resource extraction, including:</p>
  
  <ul class="list-bullet">
	  <li>October 2014: “BIA Needs Sweeping Changes to Manage the Osage Nation’s Energy Resources.” This report states that the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Osage Agency has a flawed oil and gas management program, including the policies and procedures that guide royalty payment activities, accounting, and leasing activities. The report provides 33 recommendations to improve the program.</li>
	  <li>March 2014: “Bureau of Land Management’s Mineral Materials Program.” This audit report states that, among other challenges, the BLM Mineral Materials Program has little assurance that it obtains market value for mineral materials and provides 15 recommendations to enhance the program.</li>
	  <li>September 2012: “Oil and Gas Leasing in Indian Country: An Opportunity for Economic Development.” This report concludes that Indian oil and gas leasing is not reaching its full economic potential, largely due to a lack of a dedicated and coordinated management focus at the federal level for the more than 17,000 leases on Indian lands.</li>
	  <li>May 2010: “Minerals Management Service: Royalty-In-Kind (RIK) Program’s Oil Volume Verification Process.” OIG found several areas where the RIK Program could be improved to ensure proper accounting of royalties that are paid in oil and gas volumes to the US Government, rather than in dollars.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports</h3>
  
  <p>The GAO is an independent, nonpartisan agency that investigates how the federal government spends taxpayer funds, including those for natural resource management on federal and Indian lands. GAO publishes its reports on the GAO Summary Page. Some recent GAO findings related to natural resource extraction include:</p>
  
  <ul class="list-bullet">
	  <li>December 2013: “Oil and Gas Resources: Actions Needed for Interior to Better Ensure a Fair Return.” This report examines steps DOI has taken to ensure that the public receives a fair return on oil and gas resources extracted from federal lands, as well as recommends improvements to the fiscal system.</li>
	  <li>September 2008: “Oil and Gas Royalties: The Federal System for Collecting Oil and Gas Revenues Needs Comprehensive Reassessment.” This report evaluates the government take from federal oil and gas resources and assesses DOI’s work in monitoring the performance and appropriateness of the current fiscal system.</li>
	  <li>March 1989: “The Mining Law of 1872 Needs Revision.” This report critiques the foundational mining law on three major points: that the law’s annual work requirements need to be replaced, that the law forces the federal government to sell valuable land at nominal prices, and that the patent provision runs counter to other natural resource policies.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Proposed rules</h3>
  
  <p>Per the Administrative Procedures Act, agencies propose rules to implement federal laws. The public has an opportunity to comment on all proposed rules before an agency finalizes any regulations. Recently, DOI bureaus and offices proposed new rules intended to go into effect in 2015, including:</p>
  
  <ul class="list-bullet">
	  <li>Proposed BLM rule on hydraulic fracturing available in the Federal Register publication of Oil and Gas; Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands</li>
	  <li>Proposed BLM rule on wind and solar competitive leasing available in the Federal Register</li>
	  <li>Proposed ONRR rule on consolidated federal oil and gas and federal and Indian coal valuation reform available in the Federal Register</li>
  </ul>
