<h2 id="oig-reports">Office of Inspector General (OIG) reports</h2>

[The Office of Inspector General](https://www.doioig.gov/) (OIG) is responsible for the independent oversight and promotion of excellence, integrity, and accountability within the programs, operations, and management of DOI. OIG also identifies and prevents fraud, waste, and mismanagement within the agency.

[Review OIG reports](https://www.doioig.gov/reports).

<h2 id="gao-reports">Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports</h2>

The GAO is an independent, nonpartisan agency that investigates how the federal government spends taxpayer funds, including those for natural resource management on federal and Indian lands.

[Review GAO oil and gas reports](http://www.gao.gov/key_issues/oil_and_natural_gas/issue_summary).

## Proposed rules

Per the Administrative Procedures Act, agencies propose rules to implement federal laws. The public has an opportunity to comment on all proposed rules before an agency finalizes any regulations.

For more details, search the [Federal Registrar for DOI proposed rules](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/search?conditions%5Bagencies%5D%5B%5D=interior-department&conditions%5Btype%5D%5B%5D=PRORULE).

<h2 id="dodd-frank">The Dodd-Frank Act</h2>

In 2010, the U.S. enacted the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (PDF)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ203/pdf/PLAW-111publ203.pdf) (124 Stat. 1376) to improve transparency and accountability across the financial system. Section 1504 of the act requires extractive industries companies registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to separately disclose information about payments to governments around the world in an interactive data format.

### Section 1504

Section 1504 mandated disclosure of “the type and total amount of (such) payments made for each project of the resource extraction issuer relating to the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals,” including “taxes, royalties, fees (including license fees), production entitlements, bonuses, and other material benefits, that the Commission, consistent with the guidelines of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (to the extent practicable), determines are part of the commonly recognized revenue stream for the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals.”

#### Section 1504 repeal

In early 2017, [Congress voted to roll back Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/41/). President Trump signed the resolution on February 14, 2017, nullifying Section 1504 and its disclosure requirements.

<h2 id="deepwater-horizon-oil-spill">Deepwater Horizon oil spill reforms</h2>

In the aftermath of the [Deepwater Horizon oil spill](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-OILCOMMISSION/pdf/GPO-OILCOMMISSION.pdf) in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the federal government changed the oversight of the Department of the Interior's leasing, regulation, and collection of revenue for oil and gas extraction on the Outer Continental Shelf. The post-Deepwater Horizon reorganization separated and established [independent oversight for offshore leasing](http://www.boem.gov/Reforms-since-the-Deepwater-Horizon-Tragedy/) ({{ "BOEM" | term_end }}), offshore safety and environmental enforcement ({{ "BSEE" | term_end }}), and the collection and accountability of the revenue generated from natural resource development on federal and Indian lands through the creation of the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR).

When the Secretary of the Interior announced the creation of ONRR in May 2010 and the elimination of the former Minerals Management Service in June 2010, the goals were to:

* Separate the three responsibilities of leasing, regulation, and revenue collection
* Provide each office and bureau with the independence and resources necessary to fulfill their missions
* Eliminate real and perceived conflicts associated with the previous organizations

While the federal government made regulatory reforms following the spill, Congress did not change any laws related to offshore fossil fuel management in response to the accident.
