description: The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) of 2006 created a revenue-sharing model for oil- and gas-producing gulf states. Under the act, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas receive a portion of the revenue generated from oil and gas production offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. The act also directs a portion of revenue to the Land and Water Conservation Fund.

## Revenue sharing
The [Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (PDF)](https://www.boem.gov/GOMESA/) (GOMESA) created revenue-sharing provisions for four states and their {{ "coastal political subdivisions" | term_end:"coastal political subdivision" }}:

* [Alabama]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/AL/#disbursements)
* [Louisiana]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/LA/#disbursements)
* [Mississippi]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/MS/#disbursements)
* [Texas]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/TX/#disbursements)

The act also directs a portion of gulf revenue to the {{ "Land and Water Conservation Fund" | term_end }} and bans oil and gas leasing within 125 miles of the Florida coastline in the Eastern Planning Area and a portion of the Central Planning Area until 2022.

### Purpose of funds
GOMESA funds are to be used for coastal conservation, restoration, and hurricane protection.

## Phases
There are two phases of GOMESA revenue sharing:

**Phase I**: Since 2007, 37.5% of all qualified gulf revenues are shared among the four states and their coastal political subdivisions. Revenues are generated from leases in specific planning areas defined in the act. Additionally, 12.5% of revenues are disbursed to the Land and Water Conservation Fund.

**Phase II**: The second phase of GOMESA revenue sharing started in fiscal year 2017. It expands the [areas that qualify for revenue-sharing (PDF)](https://www.boem.gov/GOMESA-Map/) under GOMESA. It also imposes a revenue-sharing cap of $500 million through 2055, although the $500 million cap does not apply to qualified revenues generated in those areas associated with Phase I of the GOMESA program.

## Expanded leasing area
The act stipulated 8.3 million acres be offered for oil and gas leasing shortly after the enactment of the statute. This acreage is included in the Central Gulf Planning Area and the Eastern Gulf Planning Area.

## Extended moratorium
The [GOMESA Moratorium](https://www.boem.gov/Areas-Under-Moratoria/) covers a portion of the Central Gulf of Mexico Planning Area and — until 2022 — most of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area.
