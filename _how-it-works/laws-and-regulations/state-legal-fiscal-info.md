<h3><a name="ak" data-nav-header="ak">Alaska</a></h3>

<p>The Division of Oil and Gas within the Alaska Department of Natural Resources is responsible for leasing state lands for oil, gas, and geothermal extraction. Its major functions include evaluating oil and gas resources, fielding and issuing exploration permits, conducting royalty audits, and negotiating contracts. The website for the Alaska Department of Natural Resources has significant information regarding statutes and regulations, leasing on state lands, and historical revenue collection and distribution information, as well as production data, for oil and gas. Additional information about statutes and regulations and leasing on state lands is available for mining from the Division of Land and Water. The Alaska Department of Revenue’s Tax Division collects state taxes, including the Oil and Gas Production Tax and Oil and Gas Property Tax, and administers tax laws. The website contains information about taxes collected and revenue sources and forecasts.</p>
