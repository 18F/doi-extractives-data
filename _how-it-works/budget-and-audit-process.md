A goal of USEITI is to support transparency in extractive industries’ payments to the United States Federal Government. Extractive industries companies (such as oil & gas or mining companies) and the U.S. Government are subject to extensive laws and regulations that guide the process for receiving payments. The four most relevant topics of laws and regulations include:

1. Payment and Collection
1. Data Validation
1. Audits and Standards
1. Publication and Disclosure

As the U.S. moves towards EITI validation and the implementation of mainstreaming, it is important to highlight that the U.S. employs a system of controls to track money flowing from extractive industries to Government bodies. 

This webpage contains information about how payments and revenues are recorded and verified in the extractive industries in the U.S. This includes the types of revenues companies are required to pay and the statutes providing authority to the U.S. Government to collect them. Likewise, it illustrates where these payments are recorded, how they are verified, and how they are publicized. 

Links below provide additional information on key agencies, standards, and processes that support transparency in extractive industries’ payments. The glossary contains additional detail on key terms, supporting laws, and regulations. 

## Tracking company payments to the U.S. Government

This page highlights current processes for tracking payments from companies to U.S. Government agencies, as well as the systems in place to verify accuracy of payment data.

A company wants to look for natural resources on federal land…

Companies make payments to the 
U.S. Government for the right to explore, extract, and sell natural resources
Multiple U.S. agencies collect production-based payments, including royalties and taxes
Companies and the U.S. Government
              follow controls to test and
                           monitor financial
                             reporting accuracy
Audits and reporting 
standards verify that companies pay what they 
owe and Government 
agencies report what
 they receive
The U.S. Government disburses the extractive industry revenues it collects directly to states and to a number of specific federal accounts
To promote transparency, regulations require Government agencies to publish certain data while protecting privacy of individual company payments

The Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) is the primary Government body in charge of collecting and distributing revenues from extractive 
industries companies’ production on Federal land.

## 1. Payments and managing agencies

Extractive industries 
payments include: Taxes, Royalties, Rents, Bonuses, 
and Fees.
Several U.S. agencies are tasked with managing and collecting revenue from companies, including some who focus primarily on the extractive industries. 

__In the U.S., payments come in two types: non-tax and tax__

Companies are required to make certain payments to the U.S. Government in order to do business on Federal land. This begins with paying of bonus bids for a lease to look for oil, gas, or minerals, and moves through paying rents and royalties as companies extract resources. The USEITI focuses on corporate income taxes, although companies can pay other types of taxes as well. 

A number of U.S. Government agencies are involved in the process of managing these payments. Several different agencies collect non-tax payments depending on the type of payment, the location of exploration and production, and the type of resource being extracted. These include: Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is responsible for collecting (corporate) income taxes.  Corporations pay Federal corporate income taxes regardless of whether they extract natural resources from federal, state, or privately held lands, inside or outside of the United States, so long as they have a tax liability.

## 2. Data validation

Numerous laws and regulations require companies and Government agencies to assure the accuracy of reported payment data.

Prior to publication, different revenue payments are verified by high levels of internal and external scrutiny

There are rigorous standards that companies and the U.S. Government must follow, as standards assure revenue payment and collection are verifiable. 

Some standards relate to internal controls (such as accounting principles) while others subject data to additional management—primarily via independent audits. Controls are particularly important for companies as most data is not publically available even once validated and reported to the Government. These controls help companies report correct data on the first attempt, as companies are subject to penalties if found wrongfully calculating or reporting payments.

### 1. Companies

#### Internal standards

Companies follow standards when reporting tax and non-tax payments:

* GAAP – Public companies 
* GAAS – Private companies
* Sarbanes-Oxley Act
* Investment Company Act

#### Transaction audits

Government agencies conduct audits of company production and specific payments:

* ONRR: Examines company records to ensure accuracy of reporting and payments 
* BLM: Verifies production, permits, conducts onsite inspections
* IRS: Audits company tax returns

#### System audits

Companies are also subject to audits of their internal systems (i.e. accounting) to ensure they comply with internal standards:

### 2. U.S. government

#### Internal standards

The U.S. Government follows standards governing and requiring financial transparency and revenue reporting:

* OMB Circular No. A-123
* Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990
* U.S. GAO Green Book

#### Transaction audits

Federal agencies have Offices of Inspector Generals that perform audits which are publicly listed on websites. This is in addition to the audits that GAO performs at agencies.

#### System audits

The U.S. Government is subject to 3rd party audits to ensure that agencies follow their own internal standards. Some audits are routine, and some are ad hoc in response to events

## 3. Audits and standards

Reporting standards and third party auditors validate payment data. This includes audits of financial statements.

Standard-setting bodies monitor, regulate, and update audit and controls requirements

Professional associations and Government entities produce audit and control standards for both companies and Government agencies, protecting shareholders and taxpayers from malfeasance, waste, and abuse. Standards are important to transparency as detailed results of company audits may or may not be publically available. The indication of a passed or failed audit sufficiently demonstrates strong or weak data validation and reporting practices because of the standards auditors follow. Government audit results are publically disclosed on an annual basis. 

For more detail on the standards and audits these bodies support, see the graphic above.

## 4. Revenue disbursement

Revenues from natural resource extraction are disbursed to a variety of end recipients across the United States. 

Once revenues are collected and verified, they are disbursed to a variety of end recipients

The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) is responsible for collecting, disbursing, and verifying Federal and Indian energy and other natural resource revenues on behalf of all Americans. In FY 2015, ONRR disbursed over $9.87 billion to the U.S. Treasury, various State and American Indian accounts, and special use accounts, such as the Reclamation Fund. ONRR disbursed these amounts in accordance with legislated formulas. 

Every American benefits from the revenues generated from mineral resources, either directly through payments to Tribes and Individual Indian Mineral Owners (IIMOs) or indirectly through payments to the Historic Preservation Fund, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Reclamation Fund, States, and the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury.

### 1. State recipients

States which have natural resource extraction receive revenue disbursements from ONRR. 37 States Received Revenue payments in 2015

The $1.84 Billion Mineral revenues disbursed to States can be a significant element of a State’s financial resource picture, providing funding for local schools, roads, libraries, public buildings, and general operations, as the States deem necessary. 

**2015 Revenue recipients ($9.9 billion)

[Pie chart showing that 48% went to U.S. Taxpayers, 19% went to states, 14% went to western water users, 9% went to conservation and recreation, 9% went to American Indian tribes, and 1% went to preservation]

### 2. Federal accounts

Mineral leasing revenues are one of the U.S. Government’s greatest sources of non-tax receipts. ONRR disburses revenues directly to the U.S. Treasury as well as several other Federal beneficiaries. 

* U.S. Treasury General Fund: $4.75 Billion, funding various Government functions and programs through the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury.
* Bureau of Reclamation: $1.39 Billion, funding a significant portion of water resource development and maintenance work in the western United States.
* Land and Water Conservation Fund: ONRR transfers nearly $900 million annually to be used by Federal, State, and local Governments to help acquire, develop, and improve outdoor recreation areas.
* Indian Tribes and Indian Mineral Owners: $853 million collected from mineral leases on Indian lands are distributed regularly to Tribal Governments or IIMOs. These funds provide direct and tangible benefits to thousands of individuals, often as a major source of primary income. 
* National Historic Preservation Fund: ONRR annually transfers $150 million to NHPF as seed money to preserve and protect our Nation’s irreplaceable heritage for current and future generations.

## 5. Data publication

The various forms of payments each require different levels of publicity and transparency

Payments (non-tax and tax) from companies to the Government are closely monitored in the U.S. However, not all the data is made available to the public. 

Outside of the USEITI process, public companies are required to publish certain data—namely in SEC filings. New U.S. legislation found in the Dodd-Frank Act will require extractives companies to publicize revenue payments data, although these rules have not yet been finalized. Some companies do voluntarily publish data in order to promote transparency in the sector. 

Different regulations compel the U.S. Government to publicize information. However, the U.S. Government is limited in the amount of data it can disclose by law. As a result, the Government publishes mostly aggregate figures—thus allowing it to publicize receipt of payments without publishing privileged or competitive information. 

### Government payment reporting

The U.S. Government publishes aggregate information in as much detail as allowable by law. 

[IMAGE: three icons (mountain, diamond, and oil rig) with arrows labeled "Company 1-3" going to an image of the capitol building, with another arrow labeled "Total Payments" leading to an image of a book in an area labeled "Publication"]

Federal agencies that report on payments received from U.S. extractive industries include: [IRS, Treasury, DOI, OSMRE, ONRR]

**Applicable laws and regulations** 

The U.S. Government is subject to numerous laws governing data publication, including: 

* Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 – Ensures federal financial managements systems provide accurate, reliable, and timely information to Government managers
* Government Management Reform Act of 1994 – Requires the audited agency financial statements that cover all accounts and activities of Government agencies
* 26 U.S. Code § 6103 – Requires confidentiality of tax returns and return information
* 18 U.S. Code § 1905 – Punishes disclosure of proprietary information by a Government employee
* Indian Trusts Act of 1882 – Establishes rules for private and public trusts
* Privacy Act of 1974– Precludes the IRS from gathering information that is not used for tax administration purposes.  

### Company payment reporting

U.S. companies’ reporting requirements are different for public and non-public companies; some companies publish more data than legally required on a voluntary basis.

**Public companies** are required to file financial reports with the SEC. [SEC logo, not sure why]

* Annual Disclosure:
  * Form 10-K 
  * Form 20-F 
  * Form 40-F
* Quarterly Disclosure
  * Form 10-Q

**Non-public companies** typically use GAAP or GAAS to generate financial reports, but are not required to publicly disclose the financial or operational data.

_New legislation—Section 1504 of the Dodd Frank Act—will require U.S. extractive industry companies to publish additional payment data. Click here to learn more_
