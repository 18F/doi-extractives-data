A goal of USEITI is to support transparency in extractive industries’ payments to the United States Federal Government. Extractive industries companies (such as oil & gas or mining companies) and the U.S. Government are subject to extensive laws and regulations that guide the process for receiving payments. The four most relevant topics of laws and regulations include:

1. Payment and Collection
1. Data Validation
1. Audits and Standards
1. Publication and Disclosure

As the U.S. moves towards EITI validation and the implementation of [mainstreaming](https://eiti.org/about/strategy-update-2015-2016#Mainstreaming), it is important to highlight that the U.S. employs a system of controls to track money flowing from extractive industries to Government bodies. 

This webpage contains information about how payments and revenues are recorded and verified in the extractive industries in the U.S. This includes the types of revenues companies are required to pay and the statutes providing authority to the U.S. Government to collect them. Likewise, it illustrates where these payments are recorded, how they are verified, and how they are publicized. 

Links below provide additional information on key agencies, standards, and processes that support transparency in extractive industries’ payments. The glossary contains additional detail on key terms, supporting laws, and regulations. 

## Tracking company payments to the U.S. Government

This page highlights current processes for tracking payments from companies to U.S. Government agencies, as well as the systems in place to verify accuracy of payment data.

A company wants to look for natural resources on federal land…

Companies make payments to the 
U.S. Government for the right to explore, extract, and sell natural resources
Multiple U.S. agencies collect production-based payments, including royalties and taxes
Companies and the U.S. Government
              follow controls to test and
                           monitor financial
                             reporting accuracy
Audits and reporting 
standards verify that companies pay what they 
owe and Government 
agencies report what
 they receive
The U.S. Government disburses the extractive industry revenues it collects directly to states and to a number of specific federal accounts
To promote transparency, regulations require Government agencies to publish certain data while protecting privacy of individual company payments

The Department of the Interior’s [Office of Natural Resources Revenue](http://www.onrr.gov/About/default.htm ) (ONRR) is the primary Government body in charge of collecting and distributing revenues from extractive 
industries companies’ production on Federal land.

## Payments and managing agencies

<!-- Much of this section is duplicative with the Revenues page -->

In the U.S., there are two major types of revenue: non-tax payments and tax payments. These payments are collected, managed, and validated by [the federal agencies responsible for managing revenue from extractive industries]({{site.baseurl}}/about/#federal-agencies).

### Non-tax payments

When companies extract natural resources on federal lands and offshore areas, they pay revenue to the federal government.

* [Learn how revenues work]({{site.baseurl}}/how-it-works/revenues/) 
* [See how much each company paid in federal revenue]({{site.baseurl}}/explore/federal-revenue-by-company/2015/)

Several different agencies collect non-tax payments depending on the type of payment, the location of exploration and production, and the type of resource being extracted. These include: Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue ([ONRR](http://www.onrr.gov/Laws_R_D/default.htm)), the [Bureau of Land Management](http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/About_BLM.html) ([BLM](http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/regulations.html)), and the [Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement](http://www.osmre.gov/programs.shtm) ([OSMRE](http://www.osmre.gov/lrg.shtm)).

The types of payments — and the laws and regulations governing them — depend on the location and type of resource. Learn more about which laws, agencies, and payments apply for each natural resource:

<!-- This list repeats a fair bit of info from the diving graphic intros, in order to include BOTH links to those pages (which list the appropriate payment types for each resource) and the names of the laws (which were in the PPT) — full list in "glossary" -->

- [Offshore oil and gas revenues]({{site.baseurl}}/how-it-works/offshore-oil-gas/) are governed by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953.
- [Onshore oil and gas revenues]({{site.baseurl}}/how-it-works/onshore-oil-gas/) are governed by the Federal Oil & Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982.
- [Coal revenues]({{site.baseurl}}/how-it-works/coal/) are governed by the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947 (as amended).
- [Mining of nonenergy minerals]({{site.baseurl}}/how-it-works/minerals/) — like gold, silver, and copper — is governed by the General Mining Act of 1872, the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947, and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.
<!-- Do we want to include onshore and offshore renewables? -->

### Corporate income tax payments

<!-- Revisit "focuses on" — this could be misleading, since EITI actually focuses on non-tax revenues -->
There are many kinds of tax revenue (for instance, property taxes, severance taxes, and county production taxes), but the USEITI process focuses on [corporate income tax]({{site.baseurl}}/explore/corporate-income-tax/).

The [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.irs.gov/uac/about-irs) (IRS) is responsible for collecting federal corporate income taxes. Corporations pay federal corporate income taxes if they have a tax liability — regardless of whether they are operating on federal, state, or private land (inside or outside of the United States).

Corporate income tax is governed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which requires both publicly traded and privately held companies to pay corporate income tax.

## Data validation

Companies and government agencies are each legally responsible for reporting accurate, verifiable payment data.

Controls and standards (like accounting principles) help companies report correct data on the first attempt, which is important because they may be subject to penalties if they calculate or report payments incorrectly.

Once submitted, reports are verified before the government publishes payment data. Finally, independent audits of financial statements, transactions, and systems help ensure compliance with internal and external standards.

<!-- Don't love "can be trusted" — work on this phrase -->
Professional associations and government agencies set standards establishing consistent processes and outcomes, so audit results can be trusted — even when detailed results aren't publicly available.


### Company standards and systems

**Publicly traded** companies in the U.S. follow the generally accepted accounting principles developed by the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/LandingPage&cid=1175805317350). The [Public Company Accounting Oversight Board](https://pcaobus.org/Pages/default.aspx) and [Security and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/) also provide oversight.

**Privately held** companies in the U.S. follow the [generally accepted auditing standards (PDF)](http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/AuditAttest/DownloadableDocuments/AU-00150.pdf) developed by the [American Institute of CPAs](http://www.aicpa.org/Pages/default.aspx).

Standard-setting bodies shape audit requirements for companies and government agencies. Prior to the [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (PDF)](https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/soa2002.pdf), the auditing profession was self-regulated. 

<!-- Learn more about this link -->
* [Investment Company Act (PDF)](https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/ica40.pdf)

**Auditing**

ONRR examines company records to verify accuracy of reporting and payments, and the IRS audits company tax returns.

<!-- If inspection/enforcement is in scope for this section, we probably need to include BSEE and mining agencies
* The Bureau of Land Management [Inspection and Enforcement Program](http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/oil_and_gas/Energy_Facts_Enforcement.html) verifies production, permits, conducts onsite inspections
-->

The IRS and [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/about/whatwedo.shtml) also periodically audit companies' internal systems to ensure they comply with standards.

The [Sarbanes-Oxley legislation (PDF)](https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/soa2002.pdf) enhances corporate responsibility, requires financial disclosures, and combats fraud.

### Federal standards and systems

The U.S. government follows standards that require financial transparency and govern how revenue is reported:

* The [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/financial_default) (OMB) defines management responsibilities for internal controls in the federal government in [OMB Circular No. A-123](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a123_rev).
* The role of OMB and responsibilities of each agency are governed by the [Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990](http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/npr/library/misc/cfo.html).
* The U.S. Government Accountability Office publishes the _Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government_, which is also known as the [Green Book](http://www.gao.gov/greenbook/overview).

**Auditing**

Federal agencies are subject to both transactional and systemic audits, which are conducted by one of these organizations:

* Each federal agency has an Office of the Inspector General (OIG), which performs most transaction-level auditing for the agency, though OIGs may also conduct system audits.
  * [Independent Auditors' Report on the U.S. Department of the Interior Financial Statements for Fiscal Years 2015 and 2014](https://www.doioig.gov/reports/independent-auditors-report-us-department-interior-financial-statements-fiscal-years-2015)
* The Government Accountability Office also audits agencies throughout the government.
* In some situations, private firms are asked to assist in auditing agencies.

Many audits are routine, but they may be triggered by events or disclosures. These audits are supported by standards, such as the GAO's _Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards_, or [Yellow Book](http://www.gao.gov/yellowbook/overview), and [OMB Bulletin 14-02 (PDF)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2014/b-14-02.pdf), which establishes minimum requirements for audits of federal financial statements.

Government audit results are publicly disclosed on an annual basis.

## 4. Revenue disbursement

Revenues from natural resource extraction are disbursed to a variety of end recipients across the United States. 

Once revenues are collected and verified, they are disbursed to a variety of end recipients

The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) is responsible for collecting, disbursing, and verifying Federal and Indian energy and other natural resource revenues on behalf of all Americans. In FY 2015, ONRR disbursed over $9.87 billion to the U.S. Treasury, various State and American Indian accounts, and special use accounts, such as the Reclamation Fund. ONRR disbursed these amounts in accordance with legislated formulas. 

Every American benefits from the revenues generated from mineral resources, either directly through payments to Tribes and Individual Indian Mineral Owners (IIMOs) or indirectly through payments to the Historic Preservation Fund, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Reclamation Fund, States, and the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury.

### Government revenue disbursement

### 1. State recipients

States which have natural resource extraction receive revenue disbursements from ONRR. 37 States Received Revenue payments in 2015

The $1.84 Billion Mineral revenues disbursed to States can be a significant element of a State’s financial resource picture, providing funding for local schools, roads, libraries, public buildings, and general operations, as the States deem necessary. 

**[2015 Revenue recipients](http://statistics.onrr.gov/ReportTool.aspx) ($9.9 billion)**

[Pie chart showing that 48% went to U.S. Taxpayers, 19% went to states, 14% went to western water users, 9% went to conservation and recreation, 9% went to American Indian tribes, and 1% went to preservation]

### 2. Federal accounts

Mineral leasing revenues are one of the U.S. Government’s greatest sources of non-tax receipts. ONRR disburses revenues directly to the U.S. Treasury as well as several other Federal beneficiaries. 

* U.S. Treasury General Fund: $4.75 Billion, funding various Government functions and programs through the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury.
* Bureau of Reclamation: $1.39 Billion, funding a significant portion of water resource development and maintenance work in the western United States.
* Land and Water Conservation Fund: ONRR transfers nearly $900 million annually to be used by Federal, State, and local Governments to help acquire, develop, and improve outdoor recreation areas.
* Indian Tribes and Indian Mineral Owners: $853 million collected from mineral leases on Indian lands are distributed regularly to Tribal Governments or IIMOs. These funds provide direct and tangible benefits to thousands of individuals, often as a major source of primary income. 
* National Historic Preservation Fund: ONRR annually transfers $150 million to NHPF as seed money to preserve and protect our Nation’s irreplaceable heritage for current and future generations.

## Data publication

Payments (non-tax and tax) from companies to the Government are closely monitored in the U.S. However, not all the data is made available to the public.

The various forms of payments each require different levels of publicity and transparency

Outside of the [USEITI process](https://useiti.doi.gov/explore/reconciliation/), public companies are required to publish certain data — namely in SEC filings. New U.S. legislation found in the Dodd-Frank Act will require extractives companies to publicize revenue payments data, although these rules have not yet been finalized. Some companies do voluntarily publish data in order to promote transparency in the sector. 

Different regulations compel the U.S. government to publicize information. However, the U.S. government is limited in the amount of data it can disclose by law. As a result, the Government publishes mostly aggregate figures—thus allowing it to publicize receipt of payments without publishing privileged or competitive information. 

### Government payment reporting

The U.S. Government publishes aggregate information in as much detail as allowable by law. 

[IMAGE: three icons (mountain, diamond, and oil rig) with arrows labeled "Company 1-3" going to an image of the capitol building, with another arrow labeled "Total Payments" leading to an image of a book in an area labeled "Publication"]

Federal agencies that report on payments received from U.S. extractive industries include: [[IRS](https://www.irs.gov/publications/), [Treasury](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/combStmt/current_rpt.htm), [BLM](http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/blm-library/publications/blm_publications.html), [OSMRE](http://www.osmre.gov/resources/InformationFor.shtm), [ONRR](http://statistics.onrr.gov/)]

**Applicable laws and regulations** 

The U.S. Government is subject to numerous laws governing data publication, including: 

* [Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/financial_ffs_ffmia) – Ensures federal financial managements systems provide accurate, reliable, and timely information to Government managers
* Government Management Reform Act of 1994 – Requires the audited agency financial statements that cover all accounts and activities of Government agencies
* [26 U.S. Code § 6103](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6103) – Requires confidentiality of tax returns and return information
* [18 U.S. Code § 1905](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1905) – Punishes disclosure of proprietary information by a Government employee
* [Indian Trusts Act of 1882 (pdf)](http://www.bu.edu/bucflp/files/2012/01/Indian-Trusts-Act-No.-2.pdf) – Establishes rules for private and public trusts
* Privacy Act of 1974– Precludes the IRS from gathering information that is not used for tax administration purposes.  

### Company payment reporting

U.S. companies’ reporting requirements are different for public and non-public companies; some companies publish more data than legally required on a voluntary basis.

**Public companies** are required to file financial reports with the SEC. [[SEC logo](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)]

* Annual Disclosure:
  * Form 10-K 
  * Form 20-F 
  * Form 40-F
* Quarterly Disclosure
  * Form 10-Q

**Non-public companies** typically use GAAP or GAAS to generate financial reports, but are not required to publicly disclose the financial or operational data.

_New legislation—Section 1504 of the [Dodd Frank Act (pdf)](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2015/34-76620.pdf) — will require U.S. extractive industry companies to publish additional payment data. [Click here to learn more](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-277.html)_

## Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR)

The Department of the Interior is involved in managing mineral leases in the U.S., led by ONRR

The Federal Oil an Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 (FOGRMA) requires monthly distribution and disbursement of payments to the Government for mineral leasing revenues and authorizes penalties for violations. The distribution and disbursement functions within ONRR ensure proper distribution of payments. 

ONRR’s mission is to collect, disburse, and verify Federal and Indian energy and other natural resource revenues on behalf of all Americans.  Each month, ONRR receives and processes 49,000 royalty and production reports. To ensure that ONRR collects the proper revenues, it performs automated processes coordinating payments and reporting with industry and the U.S. Government, and may perform further controls such as audits to ensure proper payments.

### Government revenue disbursement

### [Verification of payments (see pages 159-160)](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/FY2017_OS_Budget_Justification.pdf)

To ensure ONRR collects the proper revenues on Federal lands, ONRR performs automated processing of royalty and production reports, coordinating reporting and payment matters with industry, State Governments, American Indian Tribes, and other Federal agencies. 

**Time from payment receipt**

* Company Submits 2014s/ OGORs Companies submit 2014s/ OGORs to ONRR.
* 1 month: [Up-Front System Edits (pdf; page 160)](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/FY2017_OS_Budget_Justification.pdf) are the first layer of screening that ONRR uses to verify royalty and production reports. They include: transportation/ processing limits, multiple royalty rates, pricing edits, and reviewing agreement numbers.
* 6-9 months: [Data Mining (pdf; page 159)](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/FY2017_OS_Budget_Justification.pdf) efforts increase the accuracy of company-reported data before data is subjected to compliance reviews and audits. Missing reports, adjustment monitoring, adjustments to completed cases, net negative, and production comparisons are key components of data mining efforts to ensure company payments are accurate and verifiable. 
* 2-3 years: [Compliance Reviews (pdf; page 163)](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/FY2017_OS_Budget_Justification.pdf) are the first layer of screening that ONRR uses to verify royalty and production reports. They include: transportation/ processing limits, multiple royalty rates, pricing edits, and reviewing agreement numbers.
* 7 years: [Audits (pdf; page 163)](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/FY2017_OS_Budget_Justification.pdf) have a high standard of verification in the form of evidence from company source document and records–resulting in greater certainty of accurate payment and reporting. Audits are performed in accordance with GAGAS.

#### Internal controls

ONRR’s own processes are subject to standards and verification from 3rd parties

1. [KPMG/third party audits (pdf)](https://www.doioig.gov/sites/doioig.gov/files/2015FIN046Public.pdf) – In addition to annual Office of the Inspector General audits, third parties (external) audit ONRR’s financial functions annually. 
2. [GAGAS (pdf)](http://www.gao.gov/assets/590/587281.pdf) – Framework used for conducting high quality audits with competence, integrity, objectivity, and independence. Audits have a high standard of verification in the form of evidence for company source documents and records – resulting in greater accuracy of payment and reporting.
3. [USSGL (pdf)](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/ref/ussgl/tfm_archive/effective08_dec07/08-01R/2008/part2_ussgl_08-01.pdf) – ONRR uses USSGL accounts to prepare external reports to OMB and the U.S. Treasury to provide financial information for inclusion in its annual consolidated Interior Agency Financial Report.
4. [CFO Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/financial_ffs_ffmia) – The CFO Act requires annual audits of Department of the Interior’s financial statements that include a thorough review of ONRR’s mineral revenue custodial accounts.

#### Enforcement mechanisms

If ONRR discovers inaccurate payments, it has several enforcement mechanisms at its disposal:

1. [Alternative Dispute Resolution](http://www.onrr.gov/compliance/ADR.htm) – ONRR establishes meetings with companies and auditors to discuss disputed issues or negotiating settlements of disputes when there was a risk that ONRR might not prevail in litigation.
2. [Litigation (pdf; see page 164)](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/FY2017_OS_Budget_Justification.pdf)  – ONRR provides litigation support to the Office of the Solicitor and Department of Justice in appeals before the Department and in Federal Court. Litigation support includes preparing proofs of claims to submit in bankruptcy cases and collecting any monies due.
3. [Civil Penalties](http://www.onrr.gov/compliance/civil-penalties.htm)  – The Civil Penalty program is a tool ONRR uses to encourage compliance and to deter future violations. ONRR issues civil penalties when companies fail to comply with or knowingly or willfully violate applicable regulations or laws.

#### If a company overpays or underpays ONRR

If a company submits a monthly report in which there is underpayment, it goes to accounts-recievables accountants. If it remains underpaid, it goes on to debt collection staff. If the account is overpaid, the company is asked to use a future obligation or is paid a refund.
