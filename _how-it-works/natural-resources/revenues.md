  <h1>Revenues</h1>
  
  <h2>Revenue companies pay for natural resources</h2>
  
  <h3>DOI revenue from extraction on federal lands</h3>
  
  <p>When companies extract natural resources on federal onshore lands and the Outer Continental Shelf, they pay revenue to DOI. In general, for extracting fossil fuels and renewable resources, companies pay bonuses, rents, royalties, or fees and penalties (if incurred) to ONRR, and in some cases bonuses and rents to BLM. Royalties, a percentage of the sales value of extracted resources, make up most of the revenue paid to DOI. Lease holders also pay different fees to BLM, BSEE, and BOEM, often to reimburse the federal government for costs associated with awarding, administering, and enforcing leases. For extracting locatable hardrock minerals on federal lands, companies pay fees, but not royalties under the Mining Law of 1872.</p>

  <h3>Federal corporate income taxes</h3>
  
  <p>Corporations operating in the extractive industries also pay taxes to the IRS on their income. These companies pay federal corporate income taxes regardless of whether they extract natural resources from federal, state, or privately held lands, inside or outside of the United States, so long as they have a liability. These companies also pay taxes on income stemming from extracting natural resources and processing them into other products and commodities. There are different types of companies operating in these industries, with different ownership structures, and as a result, they are treated as different taxpayers. Specifically, there are:</p>
  
  <ul class="list-bullet">
	  <li>C-corporations with many shareholders who own the company; these companies pays corporate income taxes to the IRS</li>
	  <li>S-corporations with 100 shareholders or less who own the company; shareholders pay personal income taxes to the IRS</li>
	  <li>Partnerships where two or more members own the business; members individually pay income taxes to the IRS</li>
	  <li>Sole proprietorships with one individual owner; the individual owner pays personal income tax to the IRS</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Only income taxes from C-corporations are included in the 2015 USEITI Report.</p>
  
  <h3>Revenue policy provisions</h3>
  
  <p>While royalty rates can reach as high as 18.75%, and the federal corporate income tax rate can reach as high as 35% depending on company income, companies may pay less than these rates. Revenue policy provisions, including royalty relief and tax expenditures, can result in smaller revenue and tax payments to the federal government in order to promote other policy goals.</p>
  
  <h4>Royalty relief</h4>
  
  <p>To incentivize companies to produce additional oil and gas on certain leases on the Outer Continental Shelf where extraction is anticipated to be unprofitable, the federal government may grant some lease holders royalty relief. Royalty relief means that these lease holders do not have to pay royalties on some amount of production, or they pay a smaller percentage of royalties, for the oil and gas they extract. There are four situations in which a lease holder may gain royalty relief either within the lease terms or through an application process:</p>
  
  <ul class="list-bullet">
	  <li>Leases in deep waters with depths greater than 200 meters in the Gulf of Mexico. (This type of relief has not been offered in several years, though existing leases do include it currently.)</li>
	  <li>Leases in shallow waters with depths under 400 meters for deep gas production</li>
	  <li>Leases towards the end of their lives in which halving royalties would encourage additional production</li>
	  <li>Special cases in which continued production under existing terms is projected to be unprofitable</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In some situations, if oil and gas prices rise above certain thresholds, lease holders that previously gained royalty relief must start paying royalties at the regular rate once again.</p>
  
  <h3>Tax expenditures</h3>
  
  <p>Tax expenditures are <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/Tax-Expenditures-FY2017-Revised.pdf">defined in the law</a> as “revenue losses attributable to provisions of the federal tax laws which allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income or which provide a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability.” These exceptions may be viewed as alternatives to other policy instruments, such as spending or regulatory programs.</p>
  
  <p>The Treasury estimates the total dollar amount of each tax expenditure in a given year, and publishes a <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/Tax-Expenditures-FY2015.pdf">report of these estimates</a>:</p>
  
  <ul class="list-bullet">
	  <li>Fossil fuels: For FY 2013, expensing of exploration and development costs for fuels was the largest of five expenditures, totaling $550 million.</li>
	  <li>Renewable energy: For FY 2013, the energy investment credit was the largest of four expenditures, totaling $2 billion. The energy production credit was the second largest, totaling $1.7 billion.</li>
	  <li>Nonenergy materials: For FY 2013, the excess of percentage-over-cost depletion for nonenergy minerals was the largest of two expenditures, totaling $580 million.</li>
  </ul>
    
  <p>The budget of the federal government also includes annual estimates of the net revenue effects of eliminating a wider range of fossil fuel related tax expenditures outlined in <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/open/Documents/USA%20FFSR%20progress%20report%20to%20G20%202014%20Final.pdf">United States – Progress Report on Fossil Fuel Subsidies</a>. When added together, eliminating fossil fuel tax expenditures would decrease the U.S. deficit by $4.4 billion a year on average over a 10-year budget window, per estimates in the White House report titled, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/16msr.pdf">Fiscal Year 2016 Mid-Session Review: Budget of the U.S. Government</a>. The report did not include estimates of the effects of eliminating renewable and nonenergy mineral tax expenditures.</p>
  
  <h2>Where does federal revenue go?</h2>
  
  <p>Once collected, the federal government distributes revenue from natural resource extraction for public use in a variety of ways. Federal corporate income taxes go to the General Fund of the Treasury (the “General Fund”), and Congress determines how to allocate these resources each year through the appropriations process.</p>
  
  <p>In comparison, DOI revenue from extraction on federal lands goes to many different funds and entities. In FY 2013, ONRR disbursed $14.187 billion in DOI revenue. The recipient of these funds depends on whether the revenue is derived from onshore or offshore natural resource extraction.</p>
  
  <h3>DOI onshore revenue distribution</h3>
  
  <p>In FY 2013, ONRR disbursed <a href="http://statistics.onrr.gov/ReportTool.aspx">$5.141 billion</a> in revenue from natural resource extraction on federal and Indian lands. ONRR disbursed this revenue across recipient entities as follows:</p>

  <h3>Federal budget process</h3>
  
  <p>Once extractive industries’ revenue is collected by the federal government, it passes through a series of budgetary “gateways” before ultimately funding public services and community development. These gateways are described below:</p>
