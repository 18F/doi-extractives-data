  <h1>Tax Expenditures</h1>

  <p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury provides estimates for tax expenditures related to extracting fossil fuels, developing renewable energy, and extracting nonenergy minerals. The table below provides details and estimates for each of the relevant tax expenditures, using 2013 data.</p>

  <p>The Treasury also publishes a <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/Tax-Expenditures-FY2015.pdf">report of these estimates (PDF)</a>.</p>

		<td>Expensing of exploration and development costs, fuels</td>
		<td>Taxpayers may elect to currently deduct intangible drilling costs (IDCs) paid or incurred with respect to the development of an oil or natural gas property located in the U.S. For an integrated oil company that has elected to expense IDCs, 30% of IDCs on productive wells must be capitalized and amortized over a 60 month period.</td>
		<td>The expensing, rather than capitalization, of IDCs provides a tax preference to the oil and natural gas industry. Requiring capitalization of IDCs would place the oil and natural gas industry on a cost recovery system similar to that employed by other industries and reduce economic distortions.</td>
		<td>$550 million</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Excess of percentage over cost depletion, fuels</td>
		<td>Depletion is available to any person having an economic interest in a producing oil and natural gas property. There are generally two types of depletion: cost and percentage depletion. Cost depletion is limited to the taxpayer’s basis in the property, whereas percentage depletion is not limited by the basis, but is subject to other limitations.<br>
        Percentage depletion for producing oil and natural gas property (15% rate) is available only to independent producers and royalty owners and is limited to average production of 1,000 barrels of oil per day or its natural gas equivalent. The percentage depletion deduction is further generally limited to the lesser of 65% of the taxable income before the depletion allowance or 100% of the taxable income from the property before the depletion allowance.<br>
        Percentage depletion is also available for coal and lignite (10% rate) and oil shale (15% rate). The percentage depletion deduction is generally subject to the alternative minimum tax at a 20% rate to the extent it exceeds the adjusted basis of the property. The deduction may not exceed 50% of the net income from the mineral property in any year.</td>
		<td>Percentage depletion effectively provides a lower rate of tax with respect to a favored source of income relative to cost depletion. Cost depletion computed by reference to the taxpayer’s basis in the property would place oil and natural gas producers on a cost recovery system similar to that employed by other industries and reduce economic distortions.</td>
		<td>$530 million</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Amortize all geological and geophysical expenditures over 2 years</td>
		<td>Geological and geophysical expenditures incurred by independent producers in connection with domestic oil and natural gas exploration may be amortized over two years. For integrated oil companies, these costs must be amortized over seven years.</td>
		<td>The accelerated amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures incurred by independent producers provides a tax preference to the oil and natural gas industry.  Increasing the amortization period for geological and geophysical expenditures incurred by independent oil and natural gas producers from two to seven years would provide a more accurate reflection of their income and more consistent tax treatment for all oil and natural gas producers.</td>
		<td>$100 million</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Capital gains treatment of royalties on coal</td>
		<td>Royalties received on the disposition of coal generally qualify for treatment as long-term capital gain and the royalty owner does not qualify for percentage depletion with respect to the coal. This treatment does not apply unless the taxpayer has been the owner of the mineral in place for at least one year before it is mined. The treatment also does not apply to income realized as a co-adventurer, partner, or principal in the mining of the mineral or to certain related party transactions.</td>
		<td>The capital gain treatment of coal and lignite royalties provides a tax preference to these fossil fuel industries. Treating royalties as ordinary income would place taxpayers in that industry on a cost recovery system similar to that employed by other industries and reduce economic distortions.</td>
		<td>$90 million</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Exception from passive loss limitation for working interests in oil and gas properties</td>
		<td>Under normal rules, passive losses that remain after being netted against passive income generally can only be carried forward to offset passive income in future years. The exception permits losses from working interests in oil and gas properties to offset active income. The exception is only available if the working interest is owned in a way that does not limit the taxpayer’s liability.</td>
		<td>The special tax treatment of working interests in oil and natural gas properties provides a tax preference to the oil and natural gas industries. Eliminating the working interest exception would subject oil and natural gas properties to the same limitations as other activities and reduce economic distortions.</td>
		<td>$20 million</td>

		<td>Energy investment credit</td>
		<td>The tax code provides credits for investments in solar and geothermal energy property, qualified fuel cell power plants, stationary microturbine power plants, geothermal heat pumps, small wind property and combined heat and power property. Owners of renewable power facilities that qualify for the energy production credit may instead elect to take an energy investment credit.</td>

As of March 2010, issuers of the unused authorization of such bonds could opt to receive direct payment with the yield becoming fully taxable.</td>

		<td>Excess of percentage over cost depletion, nonfuel minerals</td>
		<td>The tax system’s default allows the taxpayer to deduct the decline in the economic value of an investment over time. Under current law, however, most nonfuel mineral extractors may use percentage depletion (whereby the deduction is fixed as a percentage of revenue and can exceed total costs) rather than cost depletion, with percentage depletion rates ranging from 22% for sulfur to 5% for sand and gravel.</td>
		<td>Over the life of an investment, percentage depletion deductions can exceed the cost of the investment. Consequently, percentage depletion offers more generous tax treatment than would cost depletion, which would limit deductions to an investment’s cost.</td>
		<td>$580 million</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Expensing of exploration and development costs, nonfuel minerals</td>
		<td>Certain capital outlays associated with exploration and development of nonfuel minerals may be expensed rather than depreciated over the life of the asset.</td>
		<td>The tax system’s default allows the taxpayer to deduct the depreciation of an asset according to the decline in its economic value over time. However, this does not always hold true with exploration and development of nonfuel minerals, as captured in this tax expenditure for the expensing of exploration and development costs for nonfuel minerals.</td>
