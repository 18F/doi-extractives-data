The [Land and Water Conservation Fund](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/lwcf/index.htm) provides competitive grants to states for local preservation and recreation projects, along with a federal portion to acquire lands and waters for public recreation or cultural preservation.

## Funding priorities
The LWCF funds landscape conservation, outdoor recreation, and the needs of local communities, including:

- access to outdoors
- national trails
- working lands (e.g. private working farms, forests, and ranches)
- historic or cultural sites
- urban parks
- wildlife habitat

## Authorization and funding
The LWCF is authorized through September 30, 2018, at which time Congress must decide whether to reauthorize the program.

The fund doesn't receive any tax revenue, but is instead funded largely by offshore oil and gas revenue. {{ "ONRR" | term }} disburses that revenue to the fund each year.

The LWCF is authorized to receive and distribute $900 million each year, but the fund is subject to congressional budget appropriations. Actual annual appropriations to the fund have met the authorized threshold only once (2001), while appropriations have been limited to between $255 million and $450 million since 2008.

## Distribution of funds
Funds from the LWCF are distributed to support two general purposes:

- [federal acquisition of land](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/lwcf/federalside.htm) for the benefit of the public
- grants to states for recreational planning, acquiring recreational lands, or developing outdoor recreational facilities 

Every year during the budget process, Congress determines the total appropriation from the fund to support each of these purposes.

### Federal land acquisition
Federal land management agencies include the Forest Service, National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management.

During the annual budget process, these agencies can submit proposals to acquire lands or waters with LWCF funds. LWCF funds for land acquistion can be carried over from fiscal year to fiscal year until expended.

### State and local grant funding
Administered by the National Park Service, the stateside program of the LWCF provides matching grants to states for planning, acquiring lands and waters, and developing facilities for outdoor recreation. LWCF funds are limited to 50% or less of a proposed project's total cost; the rest must come from other funds.

A formula in the Land and Water Conservation Act determines how the funds are apportioned to states [(54 U.S.C. ยง200305(b))](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/USCODE-2014-title54/USCODE-2014-title54-subtitleII-chap2003-sec200305). States must use the money for its intended purpose within three years.

#### GOMESA grants
The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) of 2006 specifies 12.5% of revenues from certain gulf leases be directed to the LWCF stateside program. States can receive up to $125 million in funding. This portion of LWCF funds is not subject to congressional appropriation, and states can roll it over beyond the three-year limit of other LWCF state grants.
