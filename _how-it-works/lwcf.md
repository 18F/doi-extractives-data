Administered by the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/lwcf/index.htm), the LWCF provides competitive grants to states for local preservation and recreation projects, along with a federal portion to acquire lands and waters for public recreation or cultural preservation.

## Funding priorities
The LWCF funds landscape conservation, outdoor recreation, and the needs of local communities, including:

- access to outdoors
- national trails
- working lands (e.g. private working farms, forests, and ranches)
- historic or cultural sites
- urban parks
- wildlife habitat

## Authorization and funding
The LWCF is authorized through September 30, 2018, at which time Congress must decide whether to reauthorize the program.

The fund doesn't receive any tax revenue, but is instead funded largely by offshore oil and gas revenue.{{ "ONRR" | term }} disburses that revenue to the fund each year.

The LWCF is authorized to receive and distribute $900 million each year, but the fund is subject to congressional budget appropriations. Actual annual appropriations to the fund have met the authorized threshold only once (2001), while appropriations have been limited to between $255 million and $450 million since 2008.
