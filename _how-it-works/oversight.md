> Data about revenue from the extractive industries is subject to a number of controls, standards, and regulations in the United States. Companies and governments are accountable to internal and external oversight that ensures correct reporting and publication of payments. <!-- In order to be considered for mainstreaming, the USEITI Independent Administrator has assessed existing systmes for data validation, independent audit, and disclosures. https://eiti.org/about/strategy-update-2015-2016#Mainstreaming  -->

# Data validation and auditing

Companies and government agencies are each legally responsible for reporting accurate, verifiable payment data.

Controls and standards (like accounting principles) help companies report correct data on the first attempt, which is important because they may be subject to penalties if they calculate or report payments incorrectly.

Once submitted, reports are verified before the government publishes payment data. Finally, independent audits of financial statements, transactions, and systems help ensure compliance with internal and external standards.

## Company standards and oversight

Standard-setting bodies shape accounting and auditing requirements for companies and government agencies.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was developed to enhance corporate responsibility, require financial disclosures, and combat fraud. It requires all financial reports for larger public companies to include an Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) assertion by company management and an ICFR attestation by an independent auditor.[^1] Prior to 2002, the auditing profession was largely self-regulated.

**Publicly traded** companies in the U.S. follow Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).[^2]

The [Public Company Accounting Oversight Board](https://pcaobus.org/Pages/default.aspx), a nonprofit corporation established by Congress, helps confirm that registered public accounting firms are operating in accordance with auditing standards. The [Security and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/) (SEC) requires public companies to have their financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or the International Financial Reporting Standards, and requires annual audits by independent registered public accounting firms.

**Privately held** companies in the U.S. follow Generally Accepted Auditing Standards, which define the minimum standards for auditing private companies.[^3] Audits may also require additional work beyond what is defined in these standards.

### Federal audits of company records and systems

The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) regularly examines company records to verify accuracy of reporting and payments. The [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.irs.gov/) (IRS) audits company tax returns.

The IRS and SEC also periodically audit companies' internal systems to ensure they comply with standards.

## Federal standards and oversight

The U.S. government follows standards that require financial transparency and govern how revenue is reported:

- OMB Circular A-123 prescribes responsibilities for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls and financial management systems.[^4]
- The roles and responsibilities of each agency are governed by the _Chief Financial Officers Act_.[^5]
- The [Government Accountability Office](http://www.gao.gov/) (GAO) publishes _Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government_, also known as the [Green Book](http://www.gao.gov/greenbook/overview).

A number of oversight bodies help ensure the accuracy and transparency of federal revenue reporting:

- Each federal agency has an Office of the Inspector General (OIG), which performs regular audits of the agency.
- The Chief Financial Officers Act requires annual audits of financial statements.
- The GAO also audits agencies throughout the government.
- In some situations, third-party auditors assist in performing audits. For instance, accounting firm KPMG helped provide an [Independent Auditors' Report on the U.S. Department of the Interior Financial Statements for Fiscal Years 2015 and 2014](https://www.doioig.gov/reports/independent-auditors-report-us-department-interior-financial-statements-fiscal-years-2015).

Many reviews are routine, but audits may also be triggered by events or disclosures. These audits are required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and supported by standards like the GAO's _Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards_, or [Yellow Book](http://www.gao.gov/yellowbook/overview).[^6]

The [U.S. Standard General Ledger](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/ref/ussgl/ussgl_home.htm) provides a uniform chart of accounts and technical guidance for standardizing federal agency accounting to OMB and the U.S. Treasury.

Government audit results are publicly disclosed on an annual basis.

# Data publication

## Company payment reporting

Reporting requirements are different for publicly traded and privately held companies in the U.S.

- **Public companies** are required to file financial reports with the SEC.[^7]
- **Privately held companies** are not required to publicly disclose their financial or operational data.

Some companies voluntarily publish data in order to promote transparency. One example of voluntary participation is the [USEITI reconciliation process](https://useiti.doi.gov/explore/reconciliation/).

New legislation (proposed changes to the Dodd-Frank Act[^8]) will also require extractive industry companies to publicize revenue payment data, although these rules are not yet finalized.[^9]

## Federal revenue reporting

Laws and regulations compel the federal government to publish some information about federal revenue, but they also constrain what data can be disclosed. As a result, most figures the federal government publishes are aggregate figures: they show that payments were received without publishing privileged or competitive information.

Many federal agencies make their reports on payments received from U.S. extractive industries available publicly online:

- [IRS publications online](https://www.irs.gov/publications/)
- [Treasury: Combined statement of receipts, outlays, and balances](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/combStmt/current_rpt.htm)
- [Bureau of Land Management (BLM) publications](http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/blm-library/publications/blm_publications.html)
- [Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) resources](http://www.osmre.gov/resources/InformationFor.shtm)
- [ONRR statistical information site](http://statistics.onrr.gov/)

The U.S. government is subject to numerous laws governing data publication:

- The [Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/financial_ffs_ffmia) ensures federal financial managements systems provide accurate, reliable, and timely information to government managers.
- The _Government Management Reform Act of 1994_ requires the audited agency financial statements that cover all accounts and activities of government agencies.
- [26 U.S. Code ยง 6103](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6103) requires confidentiality of tax returns and return information.
- [18 U.S. Code ยง 1905](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1905) punishes disclosure of proprietary information by a government employee.
- The [Indian Trusts Act of 1882 (PDF)](http://www.bu.edu/bucflp/files/2012/01/Indian-Trusts-Act-No.-2.pdf) establishes rules for private and public trusts.
- The _Privacy Act of 1974_ precludes the IRS from gathering information that is not used for tax administration purposes.

# Agencies that manage revenue payments

In the U.S., there are two major types of revenue: non-tax payments and tax payments. These payments are collected, managed, and validated by the [federal agencies]({{site.baseurl}}/about/#federal-agencies) responsible for managing revenue from extractive industries.

## Non-tax payments

When companies extract natural resources on federal lands and offshore areas, they pay revenue to the federal government. Learn more about [how revenues work]({{site.baseurl}}/how-it-works/revenues/) or [see how much each company paid in federal revenue]({{site.baseurl}}/explore/federal-revenue-by-company/2015/).

Several agencies collect non-tax payments depending on the type of payment, the location of exploration and production, and the type of resource being extracted. These include ONRR, BLM, and OSMRE. The types of payments, and the laws and regulations governing them, depend on the location and type of resource.[^10]

### Understanding how ONRR manages revenue

The [Office of Natural Resources Revenue](http://www.onrr.gov/) (ONRR) is the primary government body in charge of collecting and distributing revenues from extraction of natural resources on federal land.

Each month, ONRR receives and processes 49,000 royalty and production reports. Automated processes help ensure that these reports are handled consistently and that ONRR has collected the correct amounts, and additional controls, such as audits, help ensure that all processes are working properly.

A number of systems are in place to assure all payments and reports are accurate, and to identify missing payments or reporting discrepancies. For example, after a company submits an Oil and Gas Operations Report to ONRR, that report goes through the following controls to ensure its accuracy:[^11]

1. Automated upfront system edits take place within a month of receiving the report. These screen for issues with transportation and processing limits, multiple royalty rates, pricing edits, and agreement numbers.
2. Data mining, which may occur 3-6 months after receiving the report, helps ONRR identify missing reports, volume comparisons, high level analyses of sales volumes, royalty values, and adjustments.
3. Compliance reviews, which tend to happen 2-3 years after a report is submitted, focus on variations from expected norms. They provide assurance that royalties are being reported and paid correctly, and can result in resolution of open issues when companies provide additional documentation or make payments to address variances.
4. Audits, which can take place up to 7 years or more after reports are filed, examine both specific companies/properties and randomly-selected targets. Performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, audits help ensure more accurate payment and reporting.

**Enforcement mechanisms**

The Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 requires monthly payments to the federal government for mineral leasing revenues, and authorizes penalties for violations.

If ONRR discovers inaccurate payments, it has several enforcement mechanisms at its disposal:

- In [Alternative Dispute Resolution](http://www.onrr.gov/compliance/ADR.htm), ONRR meets with companies and auditors to discuss disputed issues or negotiate settlement of a dispute.
- ONRR provides litigation support to the Office of the Solicitor and Department of Justice. Litigation support includes preparing proofs of claims to submit in bankruptcy cases and collecting any monies due.[^12]
- The [Civil Penalty](http://www.onrr.gov/compliance/civil-penalties.htm) program is a tool ONRR uses to encourage compliance and to deter future violations. ONRR issues civil penalties when companies fail to comply with or knowingly violate regulations or laws.

<!-- Validate this process -- this is summarized from the flowchart --> If a company submits a monthly report in which there is underpayment, it goes to accounts recievables accountants. If it remains underpaid, it goes on to debt collection staff. If an account is overpaid, the company is asked to use a future obligation or is paid a refund.

**Disbursements**

Once revenues are collected and verified, ONRR disburses revenues to states, federal funds, and American Indian Tribes in accordance with legislated formulas. [Learn more about how revenue from natural resource extraction is distributed for public use.]({{site.baseurl}}/explore/disbursements/)

## Corporate income tax payments

Corporations pay federal [corporate income taxes]({{site.baseurl}}/explore/corporate-income-tax/) if they have a tax liability -- regardless of whether they are operating on federal, state, or private land (inside or outside of the United States). Corporate income tax is governed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which requires both publicly traded and privately held companies to pay corporate income tax.

The IRS is responsible for collecting federal corporate income taxes.
