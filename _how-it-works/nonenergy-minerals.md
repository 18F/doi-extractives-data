description: The United States is home to many different natural resources, including fossil fuel, renewable energy", and nonenergy mineral resources (such as gold, copper, and iron). Since the 19th century, natural resource extraction has been a major industry in the U.S., with fluctuations over time.

## Nonenergy minerals

Nonenergy minerals include base and precious metals, industrial metals, and gemstones, amongst others. Gold, copper, iron, and zinc are the principal contributors to metal mine production. In 2016, these minerals accounted for most of the valuable metal produced in the United States, which [totaled $23 billion (PDF)](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/mcs/2017/mcs2017.pdf).

Exploration for nonenergy minerals in the United States [declined by 5% from 2015 to 2016 (PDF)](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/mcs/2017/mcs2017.pdf). In 2015, six of the nine major exploration sites for nonenergy minerals in the U.S. [concentrated on gold in Nevada (PDF)](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/mflow/exploration-2015.pdf).

### Gold

Gold can be found in both loose materials and hard rocks. Miners extract gold from placer mines using sluicing, dredging, jigging, and amalgamation devices that separate the gold from water, silt, rock, and other compounds. Lode mining, both open pit and underground, extracts gold embedded within rock walls. Once mined, gold is used to make jewelry, electronics, dental treatments, and other products.

In 2015, the majority of U.S. gold came from [Nevada (162,000 kilograms) and Alaska (28,000 kilograms) (PDF)](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/gold/mis-201608-gold.pdf). In the United States, recent exploration for gold resulted in discoveries along the Carlin and Battle Mountain-Eureka (Cortez) trends in [Eureka and Elko Counties]({{ site.baseurl }}/case-studies/elko-and-eureka/), as well as in the [Pequop Mountains in Elko County](http://pubs.nbmg.unr.edu/The-NV-mineral-industry-2011-p/mi2011.htm).

### Copper

Copper is found in hard rocks in the form of copper ore. Miners extract copper from open pit and underground mines through traditional quarrying to separate the copper from rock, or leaching which involves treating the ore with diluted sulfuric acid. Once produced, copper has a variety of uses, including as a building material, as an effective conductor of electricity, and within the health care sector.

In 2015, Arizona accounted for the most copper production out of all U.S. states with [963,000 metric tons (PDF)](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mis-201607-coppe.pdf). The U.S. had the forth largest copper exploration budget in the world.

### Iron

Iron is found in underground rocks. Miners extract iron by drilling holes in the ground in carefully engineered patterns and blasting out rocks with explosives. Next, miners crush the rocks and separate out the iron ore from other materials. Almost all iron is used to make steel, which in turn is used to make buildings, infrastructure, machines, and vehicles.

In 2014, 93% of the iron ore shipped in the U.S. came from [Minnesota and Michigan (PDF)](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/iron_ore/mcs-2015-feore.pdf), and had an estimated value of $5.1 billion. [Exploration for iron decreased in Minnesota from 2014 to 2015](http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lands_minerals/exploration.html#2015), dropping from 57 exploratory holes drilled in 2014 to eight holes drilled in 2015.

### Lead

Lead is a corrosion-resistant, dense, ductile, and malleable metal. Environmental and health concerns have reduced or eliminated the use of lead in almost all non-battery products. Today, batteries account for more than 85% of lead consumption. [Read more about lead from USGS](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lead/).

### Zinc

Sphalerite or zinc oxide is the principal ore mineral in the world. Zinc is found in many items including metal products, rubber, and medicines. 75% of zinc goes into metal products to protect iron and steel from corrosion, but also to make bronze and brass. The other 25% is used by the rubber, chemical, paint, and agricultural industries. [Read more about zinc from USGS](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/zinc/).

### Silver

Silver is a metal that has been used for thousands of years. It has the highest thermal and electrical conductivity, and is the whitest color of all metals. This makes it useful in the production of mirrors, electrical and electronic products, and photography. Its estimated domestic uses today are 30% electrical and electronics, 27% coins and medals, 7% jewelry and silverware, 6% photography, and 30% other. Predominantly recovered as a byproduct, the amount of silver still in existence is unknown. [Read more about silver from USGS](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/silver/).

### Molybdenum

Molybdenum is extraordinarily resistant to heat and wear. It is typically used as an mixing agent in steel, cast iron, and superalloys to enhance hardenability, strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance. It plays a versatile and significant role in industrial technology and is also used in chemical applications such as catalysts, lubricants, and pigments.
