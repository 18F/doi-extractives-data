## Nonenergy minerals

Nonenergy minerals include base and precious metals, industrial metals, and gemstones, amongst others. The 2016 USEITI Report focuses on nonenergy minerals, specifically gold, copper, and iron. In 2015, these minerals accounted for most of the valuable metal produced in the United States, which [totaled $26.6 billion (PDF)](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/mcs/2016/mcs2016.pdf). Copper and gold both accounted for 29% of the total value, while iron made up 14% of the total worth of metal extracted.

Exploration for nonenergy minerals in the United States [declined by 6% from 2014 to 2015 (PDF)](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/mflow/exploration-2015.pdf). In 2015, six of the nine major exploration sites for nonenergy minerals in the U.S. [concentrated on gold in Nevada (PDF)](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/mflow/exploration-2015.pdf).

### Gold

Gold can be found in both loose materials and hard rocks. Miners extract gold from placer mines using sluicing, dredging, jigging, and amalgamation devices that separate the gold from water, silt, rock, and other compounds. Lode mining, both open pit and underground, extracts gold embedded within rock walls. Once mined, gold is used to make jewelry, electronics, dental treatments, and other products.

In 2015, the majority of U.S. gold came from [Nevada (162,000 kilograms) and Alaska (28,000 kilograms) (PDF)](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/gold/mis-201608-gold.pdf). In the United States, recent exploration for gold resulted in discoveries along the Carlin and Battle Mountain-Eureka (Cortez) trends in [Eureka and Elko Counties]({{ site.baseurl }}/case-studies/elko-and-eureka/), as well as in the [Pequop Mountains in Elko County](http://pubs.nbmg.unr.edu/The-NV-mineral-industry-2011-p/mi2011.htm).

### Copper

Copper is found in hard rocks in the form of copper ore. Miners extract copper from open pit and underground mines through traditional quarrying to separate the copper from rock, or leaching which involves treating the ore with diluted sulfuric acid. Once produced, copper has a variety of uses, including as a building material, as an effective conductor of electricity, and within the health care sector.

In 2015, Arizona accounted for the most copper production out of all U.S. states with [963,000 metric tons (PDF)](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mis-201607-coppe.pdf). The U.S. had the forth largest copper exploration budget in the world.

### Iron

Iron is found in underground rocks. Miners extract iron by drilling holes in the ground in carefully engineered patterns and blasting out rocks with explosives. Next, miners crush the rocks and separate out the iron ore from other materials. Almost all iron is used to make steel, which in turn is used to make buildings, infrastructure, machines, and vehicles.

In 2014, 93% of the iron ore shipped in the U.S. came from [Minnesota and Michigan (PDF)](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/iron_ore/mcs-2015-feore.pdf), and had an estimated value of $5.1 billion. [Exploration for iron decreased in Minnesota from 2014 to 2015](http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lands_minerals/exploration.html#2015), dropping from 57 exploratory holes drilled in 2014 to eight holes drilled in 2015.
