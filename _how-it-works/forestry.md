description: The United States is home to many different natural resources, including fossil fuel, renewable energy", and nonenergy mineral resources (such as gold, copper, and iron). Since the 19th century, natural resource extraction has been a major industry in the U.S., with fluctuations over time.

# Forestry

Forests cover 766 million acres of land in the United States. As a important part of our ecosystems, they provide timber and clean water, purify our air, reduce the effects of drought and floods, and hold cultural significance.

Forests are typically characterized by their ownership, capacity to produce timber, and wood type. If you want to understand forests in greater detail, visit the U.S. Forest Service.

## Ownership
Ownership of forests is either public or private.

Public
Federal, state, and local governments own 42% of forests. The Forest Service manages 191 million acres of national forests. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages 65 million acres of forests and woodlands across 12 western states and Alaska.

Private
Individuals and organizations, such as companies or non-profits, own 58% of forests. Most private forests are in the North and South.  

Tribal
Tribal lands across the U.S. include 18.2 million acres of forest.

The Forest Service manages 191 million acres of national forests. Extensive planning goes into managing national forests. Each one develops a comprehensive plan for its management based on public input and scientific insights.  

Besides creating energy, these natural resources are also used to make many products. For example, manufacturers use oil to make asphalt and coal to make steel. Through natural processes over hundreds of millions of years, plant and animal matter becomes energy resources in the form of oil, gas, and coal. While fossil fuels are abundant, they are not renewable.

### Gas

Gas, also called natural gas, forms underground on land and offshore in beds under the ocean. There are two types of natural gas: dry and wet. Dry natural gas is mostly methane. Wet natural gas contains a small amount of methane, as well as other liquid hydrocarbons — such as ethane, propane, and butane — and nonhydrocarbon gases. Wet natural gas is the source of natural gas liquids. Once wet natural gas is extracted from the ground, natural gas liquids are separated from the gas stream close to the well or at a gas processing plant. This leaves both dry gas and natural gas liquids such as ethane, propane, and butane.

The U.S. produces more gas than any other country in the world. In 2015, [five states produced 65% of the total dry natural gas](http://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/annual/): Texas, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Wyoming, and Oklahoma.

In conventional extraction, companies extract oil and gas by drilling a vertical well. At first, oil and gas rise to the surface of the well fueled by underground pressure. Once the pressure gives out, operators can inject gases or water from the initial drilling back into the formation to increase pressure and push additional resources to the surface, or install pumps to help provide artificial lift for oil production. Finally, operators can inject steam, gases, or other chemicals into the formation to change the oil’s composition so that it can more easily rise through the well.

Extraction methods for oil and gas changed significantly starting in the early 2000s, with the new applications of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking. Horizontal drilling creates lateral wells for oil and gas to flow through. Hydraulic fracturing pumps water, sand, and chemicals into the earth to fracture the shale rock so that natural gas and oil can flow through the cracks into the well and then to the surface. These methods made extracting oil and gas trapped in almost impermeable shale rock formations deep below the surface of the earth profitable for extractive industries.

In the past decade, these changing extraction methods and rising natural gas prices have made shale oil and gas increasingly attractive to extractive industries. Major oil and gas shale rock formations include the Permian, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford Regions mostly in Texas; the Marcellus Region in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York; the Niobrara Region in Wyoming and Colorado; and the Bakken Region in North Dakota and Montana.

In addition to these shale formations, the Green River Formation, which is located at the intersection of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, is estimated to hold [1.44 trillion barrels of oil (PDF)](http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3063/pdf/FS11-3063.pdf). In shale gas, two Appalachian {{ "plays" | term_end:"play" }} have driven U.S. shale gas production, which accounts for [50% of total U.S. natural gas production](http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=27612). These plays are the Marcellus Play (spanning nine states from New York to Tennessee) and the Utica Play (spanning Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York).

### Production

The majority of timber production in the United States occurs on private forests.

Types of trees harvested: hardwood and softwood 

#### What are reserves?

There are three common types of reserves, or the amount of a particular natural resource available for extraction:

* **Proved reserves** are the estimated volumes of a natural resource that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions
* **Technically recoverable resources** include natural resources that can be produced based on current technology, industry practices, and geological knowledge
* **Economically recoverable resources** are the portion of technically recoverable natural resources that can be profitably produced
