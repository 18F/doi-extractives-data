# Typography

## Font
Lato is used for all headers and text on the site.

## Weights
Light (300) is the base font weight, styled with `$weight-light;`.

Bold text (600) is styled with `$weight-bold;`.

Book (400) is an in-between weight used for sticky side navigation, all-caps chart titles, and other occasions where bold would be a little too overpowering. This is set with `$weight-book;`.
