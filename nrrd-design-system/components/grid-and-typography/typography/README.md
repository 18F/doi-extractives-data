# Typography

## Typeface
Lato is used for all headers and text on the site.

## Weights
Three weights of Lato are used on the site: Light (300), Bold (600), and Book (400).

Light is the base weight, the default. Book is an in-between weight used for sticky side navigation, all-caps chart titles, and other occasions where bold would be a little too overpowering.
