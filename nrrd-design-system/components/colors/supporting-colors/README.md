Cool grays are used widely in the site, predominantly for large background fills.

## Greens
Green represents land-ownership in maps, and data in charts. It also serves to add a bit of color to the site here and there, and helps make hierarchy more distinct when used as a rule with some headers.

Blues do not feature heavily in the site design. They're mainly reserved for links, buttons, and the county-level maps on state Explore pages.
