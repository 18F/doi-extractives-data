# Blues
Blues do not feature heavily in the site design. They're mainly reserved for links, buttons, and the county-level maps on state Explore pages.

$blue-dark is used for type fills over the $blue-cthru background color (on the filter panel for federal revenue by company, in How it works), to achieve sufficient contrast. $blue-cthru is semi-transparent, for use in filter backgrounds.


*'"Accessible" colors can be used as text fills over white backgrounds, since the contrast ratio between the color and white is at least 4.5:1.'*
