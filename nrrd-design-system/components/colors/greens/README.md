# Greens
Green represents land-ownership in maps, and data in charts. It also serves to add a bit of color to the site here and there, and helps make hierarchy more distinct when used as a rule with some headers.

*'"Accessible" colors can be used as text fills over white backgrounds, since the contrast ratio between the color and white is at least 4.5:1.'*
