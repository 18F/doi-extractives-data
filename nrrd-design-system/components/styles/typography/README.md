## Typeface
[Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?selection.family=Lato) is used for all headers and text on the site. Lato was chosen for the following features:
- it uses tabular figures, which are ideal for tables and numerical data
- stylistically it's an unassuming font which doesnâ€™t try to assert too much personality, and remains neutral
- it offers a good range of weights
- fast loading times

## Weights
Three weights of Lato are used on the site: Light (300), Bold (600), and Book (400).

Light is the base weight, the default. Book is an in-between weight used for sticky side navigation, all-caps chart titles, and other occasions where bold would be a little too overpowering.
