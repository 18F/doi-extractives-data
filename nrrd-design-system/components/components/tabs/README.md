Tabs manage peer groups of content within one parent category. They create shorter pages, and give users the ability to view (and load) only the content group they need. Each tab button has a corresponding content section.

Tabs are currently in use on national data pages for [revenue tables](https://revenuedata.doi.gov/explore/#revenue)
