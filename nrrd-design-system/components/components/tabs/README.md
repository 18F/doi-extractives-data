Tabs manage peer groups of content within one parent category. They create shorter pages, and give users the ability to view (and load) only the content group they need. Each tab button has a corresponding content section.

## Types of tabs:
- `explore-subpage-tabs` are used to separate content grouped by year. Use when the tabs need  less emphasis in relation to other navigational elements, and there are few other filters in use.
- `revenues_subpage-tabs` are used to separate large sections or whole pages of content
- `eiti-tabs` are used in tables to separate views of data within a page
