# Links

We use a variety of link styles depending on function and context. We use at least two visual characteristics in combination to denote links (e.g., color _and_ underline or color _and_ heavier weight).

* links with relatively heavy font weight (400), underline on hover
  - This style is used for side navigation and some data and documentation links.
* in-sentence links, underlined until hover
  - Comprises the majority of links on the site
* links with relatively heavy font weight (400) preceded by an icon
  - These are "call-to-action" links for data, documentation, and download links.
* links with relatively heavy font weight and trailing arrow
  - These links denote external sites, typically data providers
* glossary links, dotted underline style with book icons
  - These aren't technically links, but rather span elements that toggle an interactive glossary
