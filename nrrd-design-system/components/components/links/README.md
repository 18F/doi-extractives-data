# Links

We use a variety of link styles depending on function and context. We use at least two visual characteristics in combination to denote links (e.g., color _and_ underline or color _and_ heavier weight).

## Side navigation and some data and documentation links
* links with relatively heavy font weight (400)
* underline on hover

## In-sentence links
* underlined until hover
* comprises the majority of links on the site

## "Call-to-action" links for data, documentation, and downloads
* relatively heavy font weight (400)
* proceeded by an icon

## External sites, typically data providers
* relatively heavy font weight
* trailing arrow

## Glossary
These aren't technically links, but rather span elements that toggle an interactive glossary
* dotted underline style with book icons
