# Selectors

All selectors on the site are preceded by brief header which ends with a colon, such as "Explore data:" or "Browse this section:". The first item in the selector list should be a specific call to action, such as "Choose location". Green year selectors are an exception to this, because they default to the most recent year.

*Note: once a user clicks to view a selector's contents, its appearance changes to the default style set by the browser.*
