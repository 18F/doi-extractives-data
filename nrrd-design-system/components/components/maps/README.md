# Maps

Maps on the site are dynamically generated svgs, serve various purposes, and appear in various sizes, depending on their application. They are critically important, because they orient users and show the source of the numbers: our lands and waters.

**US maps** always include offshore regions and Alaska. Larger versions are interactive, with clickable states and regions, and include ownership [choropleths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map).

 **State and regional maps**

 **Icon-sized** maps accompany the side navigation in Explore data, and highlight the state or region being viewed.
