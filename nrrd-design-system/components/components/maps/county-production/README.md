# County production map

The county production map is an interactive map showing production values for all counties within
a single state. The map is paired with a data table so that clicking a county
highlights that county's production values within the table.


## How to use

Specify the `state_id` variable as the two-letter state abbreviation e.g. `AK`
for Alaska. Include the `location/section-ownership.html` template.
