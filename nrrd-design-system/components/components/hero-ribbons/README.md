# Hero ribbons

This high-profile banner is used only on section landing pages, and runs just below the header navigation element. The large (8-column) area on the left can hold introductory text (e.g. [About](/about), [How it works](/howitworks)) or a large, clickable US map ([Explore data](/Explore), [Case studies](/case-studies)).

The smaller (4-column) sidebar can hold:
- A [Short paragraph](/case-studies) / caption followed by a prominent call to action, such as a button or selector offering deeper access to that section
- A subhead and [bulleted list](/about) of useful links to content within that section of the site
- A [graphical callout](howitworks) that illustrates meaningful information found in that section
