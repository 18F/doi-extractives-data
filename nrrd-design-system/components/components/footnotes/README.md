# Footnotes

Footnote references are styled as superscript numbers, in traditional fashion. Each number links to its corresponding note at the bottom of the page. An ASCII return arrow (â†©) follows each footnote, which should be linked back to the referencing ID on the page. The `reversefootnote` class is applied to this arrow. **(This doesn't seem to do anything. Perhaps it did at one time, or i'm just missing it. Nix?)**
