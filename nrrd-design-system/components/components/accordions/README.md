# Accordions

Accordions are collapsible panels that provide users with the ability to expand
and collapse content as needed. They can simplify the interface by hiding
content until it is needed.

With so much data, hiding some is essential. This is especially true for mobile
where some content shown by default in the desktop view becomes hidden.


## When to use

- Users only need a few specific pieces of content within a page.
- Information needs to be displayed in a small space.


### When to consider something else

- If visitors need to see most or all of the information on a page. Use
  well-formatted text instead.
- If there is not enough content to warrant condensing. Accordions increase
  cognitive load and interaction cost, as users have to make decisions about what
  headers to click on.

Additional guidance is available from the [U.S. Web Design
System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/accordions/).
