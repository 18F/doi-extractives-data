# Sticky side navigation

This sticky component helps users keep track of where they are on some of the longer pages of the site. As the user scrolls, the name of the active section changes to bold, and if it includes subsections, those expand into view.

In the Explore section, this component includes an icon-sized US map, where the state or offshore-region page being viewed is highlighted. These function as buttons that link back to the Explore data landing page.

(explain how to use the front matter of .html files to create the structure; i'm not schooled in this)
