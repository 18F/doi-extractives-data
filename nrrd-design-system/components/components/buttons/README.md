# Buttons

Buttons represent a clear action for a user to perform.


## How to use

Buttons use the `button` element and the variant is controlled by class name
e.g. `button-primary`.


## Variants


### Primary

Primary buttons are used sparingly on the site, reserved for links to
higher-profile content like in a hero component.


### Secondary

The secondary and disabled button styles are not in use at all, but may be handy
if forms are created in the future.


### Tertiary


### Disabled

The secondary and disabled button styles are not in use at all, but may be handy
if forms are created in the future.
