# Charts

Data-driven displays are core to revenue.doi.gov, and most are in the form of compact bar charts. Like all data visualizations on the site, these charts present information without embellishment. This lets the data speak for itself. Since the volume of data is so great, numbers are generally shown for only one year at a time. This way the user isn't overwhelmed. These figures are summarized in sentence form beneath the compact charts found on Explore pages. We think this format aids in comprehension.

Details for the most current year are always shown by default.
