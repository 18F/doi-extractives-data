# Breadcrumbs

The breadcrumbs component is used for navigation and to reinforce for the user where they are within the site structure, especially for deeper site pages. Always add a slash after the text, to indicate the parent category.

This type style and positioning can also be used as a non-link running subhead. It's used in the case studies section, where an icon is added for visual interest.
