## Side-by-side bar charts
lion's share of the charts on the site are these
- size
  + compact by design, since there are so many to show, don't want to overwhelm users
  + each is three columns wide, don't enlarge or reduce
- data scope(?)
  + for consistency and scannability, these grouped bar charts have space for ten years of data
  + if more than ten years of data is available, show only the most recent ten
  + if fewer than ten years is available, leave empty slots for
  + show the same set of years for all charts on a page, don't mix and match (confirm, Corey?)
  + show the most recent year available by default

## Charts within tables
[it might be worthwhile to reference the bar charts that run in some tables]
