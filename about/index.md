About this site
===============

In support of the U.S. implementation of the international [Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative](http://eiti.org/), the Department of the Interior is providing this public data portal that tells the story of natural resource revenues from Federal lands. This website aligns with the principles of [Project Open Data](http://project-open-data.github.io/) and the goals of the [U.S. National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/12/06/united-states-releases-its-second-open-government-national-action-plan).
