# EITI Data Collection
This branch is for data collection and transformation. Everything here uses [Node](https://nodejs.org/), and the dependencies are managed with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). To get started, run:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all the data collection and transformation dependencies. If you wish to run the tests, run:

```sh
npm install --dev
npm test
```

See [this issue](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/issues/493) for some background on what we're aiming to do here.
