    <p>The ititial USEITI beta site launched in early 2015, offering visualizations that showed how such resources generate revenue across the country, and where the money earned goes.</p>

    <p>This site expands and improves on that site in response to user feedback and new data. Here's some of the ways we've made the site more useful:</p>

    <ul class="list-bullet">
      <li>A clearer explanation of USEITI and what the site is for</li>
      <li>More location-based information</li>
      <li>More explanation of the governmentâ€™s role in extractive industries</li>
      <li>Added structure to the data so casual users can get useful information and dive deeper as interested</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And here's some of the new information you can explore:</p>

    <p><strong>Production data:</strong> Sales volumes and revenue have long been used to estimate how much of a resource was produced. Here, for the first time, you can find more precise data on what resources were produced on federal lands. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/explore/federal-production/">Explore federal production data.</a></p>

    <p><strong>Federal revenue by company:</strong> See what revenue the government received from production on federal lands, sorted by company. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/explore/federal-revenue-by-company/">Explore federal revenue by company.</a></p>

    <p><strong>Reconciliation data:</strong> A number of companies were asked to submit data for reconciliation with Department of Interior revenue data. Of the 45 companies invited, 35 participated. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/explore/reconciliation/">Download reconciliation data.</a></p>

    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Beyond the numbers, we've included new narratives explaining how the whole system of leasing federal land and collecting royalties on extracted materials works in the U.S. <a href="">Learn how it works.</a></p>

    <h2>What's next</h2>

    <p>This site is still in progress. Over the coming months, here's what we're looking forward to:</p>

    <ul class="list-bullet">
      <li>USEITI has invited states to opt in to this process, with the goal of making state-level data more navigable for members of the public. In 2016, participating states will begin contributing data.</li>
      <li>In early 2016, we'll be making reconciliation data more interactive and easier to explore.</li>
      <li>We'll be collecting community feedback to help us make the site clearer and more useful. <a href="https://ethn.io/38933">Help us improve the site.</a></li>
    </ul>
