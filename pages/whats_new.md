  <p>The ititial beta site for USEITI launched in early 2015, offering visualizations that showed how such resources generate revenue across the country, and where the money earned goes. While for some resources basic data have existed for decades, EITI provided the impetus to release these data sortable by the amount the government receives in revenue by company. In addition to the data visualization, the USEITI website provides resources to help ordinary individuals better understand U.S. energy resources and policy.</p>

  <p>This site expands and improves on that site, in response to both user feedback and new data. Here's some of how we've tried to make the site more useful:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A clearer explanation of USEITI and what the site is for</li>
    <li>More location-based information</li>
    <li>More explanation of the government’s role in the natural resources industry</li>
    <li>Added structure to the data so casual users can get useful information and dive deeper as interested</li>
  </ul>

  <p>And here's some of the new information you can explore:</p>

  <p><strong>Production data:</strong> The Office of Natural Resource Revenue (ONRR) used to estimate how much of a resource was produced using sales volumes. Over the last couple years, the office has worked to more precisely calculate production numbers. <a href="">Explore production data</a></p>

  <p><strong>Reconciliation data:</strong> A number of companies were asked to submit data for reconciliation with Department of Interior (DOI) revenue data. Of the 45 companies invited, 35 participated. Five companies also allowed for corporate income tax reconciliation. This site includes downloadable <a href="">reconciliation data</a>, and we expect to make that data more interactive in early 2016.</p>

  <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Beyond the numbers, we've included new narratives of how the whole system of leasing land and collecting royalties off of the extracted materials works in the United States. <a href="">Learn how it works</a></p>

  <p>This site is still in progress. Over the coming months, here's what we're looking forward to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>USEITI has invited states to opt in to this process, with the goal of making state-level data more navigable for members of the public. In 2016, participating states will begin contributing data.</li>
  </ul>
