        <h4>Jobs</h4>
        <p>We use two types of jobs data on this site. One is <em>Wage and Salary</em> data, which describes the number of people (full-time and part-time) employed in natural resource extraction that receive wages or salaries from companies. This data is from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, specifically the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. The best way to get this data is from <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cew/datatoc.htm">this page</a> and to download CSVs single files annual averages (you will need to load titles).</p>
        <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cew/datatoc.htm" class="button-tertiary">
          Go to BLS quarterly census &#8594;
        </a>

        <p>The other type of jobs data we use is <em>Self-Employment</em>. This data describes the number of people (full-time and part-time) that are self-employed in natural resource extraction. Self-employed people don't receive wages/salary from a company because they own the company, either as a sole proprietor, in a partnership, or in a small business. This data comes from comes from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>, or BEA, but must be calculated, by subtracting SA27N Full- and Part-Time Wage and Salary Employment by NAICS Industry from SA25N Full- and Part-Time Employment by NAICS Industry.</p>
