<h1>About this site</h1>

<p>The <a href="http://www.doi.gov/">Department of the Interior</a> (DOI) is creating this public data portal to tell the story of natural resource revenues from Federal lands. It supports the <a href="http://www.doi.gov/eiti/index.cfm">U.S. implementation</a> of the international <a href="https://www.eiti.org/">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative</a>, is part of the cross-government <a href="https://project-open-data.github.io/">Project Open Data</a> and supports the goals of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/12/06/united-states-releases-its-second-open-government-national-action-plan">U.S. National Action Plan for Open Government Partnership</a>.

<p>The site itself is a collaboration between DOI and <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a>, a newly-formed organization in the <a href="http://www.gsa.gov">General Services Administration</a> that encompasses the <a href="http://wh.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellows</a> program and an in-house digital delivery team. 18F builds effective, user-centric digital services focused on the interaction between government and the people and businesses it serves.</p>
