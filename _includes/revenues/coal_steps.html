            <p>BLM evaluates federal lands for coal leasing through the multiple-use planning process, which includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identifying coal with the potential for development</li>
              <li>Determining whether the lands are suitable for coal development</li>
              <li>Considering multiple-use conflicts stemming from other desirable uses for the land in addition to coal mining</li>
              <li>Consulting with the surface owner in cases where the government owns the coal below the ground, and another party owns the land on the surface</li>
            </ul>

            <p>BLM may add stipulations or restrictions to a lease where developing coal resources could conflict with protections or management of other resources and federal land uses.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>The Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1976 requires the Federal Government to lease all federal lands available for coal leasing competitively, meaning that any interested party can compete for the coal lease. BLM primarily uses the lease by application process, in which the public nominates a particular tract of coal for competitive sale. BLM reviews each application submitted by the public to make sure it complies with land use plans. Next, a Regional Coal Team—with members from federal, state, local, and tribal governments—reviews the application in consultation with the public, and decides whether to continue, change, or reject the application. At this point, BLM prepares an Environmental Impact Statement or Environmental Assessment for public comment in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act.</p>

          <p>Next, BLM prepares to sell the lease. In advance of the sale, BLM estimates the fair market value of the coal lease—meaning the price the government estimates is fair given the value of resources on the land. BLM holds a lease sale where each bidder submitted a sealed bid; BLM opens the bids publically at the lease sale. The winning bid will be the highest bid that meets or exceeds the coal tract’s presale estimated fair market value, so long as the bidder meets all requirements (such as paying fees). Once a bid is accepted, the bidder must pay a portion of the bid amount, called the bonus, as well as the first year’s rent to BLM.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>During the explore phase, the lease holder must obtain a Coal Exploration License from the BLM in order to explore the leased land for coal deposits. Exploration is the process of discovering the specific location, quantity, and quality of natural resources on leased or claimed land. Exploration typically takes place after the lease is secured, but in some instances, exploration by multiple parties is permitted before the leasing process in order to increase competition at auction. To apply for an exploration permit, companies must submit an exploration plan detailing all planned exploration activities, including timing, location, method, and potential environmental impact. The Coal Exploration License expires two years after the BLM grants it. During the exploration period, companies pay rent on the leased or claimed land to the federal government, collected by the ONRR. Companies can choose whether or not to extend their leases based on their findings during exploration.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>After BLM awards the lease, the lease holder must still obtain the appropriate permits and licenses from BLM, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, and any affected state and local governments before operations can begin. Before the lease holder extracts coal in paying quantities, they must pay annual rent to the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR). Once the lease holder has obtained all permits, begun operations, and produced coal in paying quantities, the lease holder stops paying rent, and starts paying royalties on the value of the coal extracted to ONRR.</p>

        <button class="accordion-button" accordion-button></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>At the close of a coal mining operation, the lease holder must decommission the mine and restore the land. State governments, with oversight from the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), regulate and oversee this process. Even before gaining a lease, the lease holder must submit a bond to OSMRE or a state regulatory agency as both insurance for complying with the lease, and for covering the costs of reclaiming the land once mining operations stop.</p>

          <p>Within coal mining, a federal and local partnership exists for regulating reclamation. OSMRE is responsible for establishing a nationwide program to protect society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations. To do so, OSMRE works with states and tribes to ensure that citizens and the environment are protected during coal mining, and that the land is restored to beneficial use when mining is finished. OSMRE and its partners are also responsible for reclaiming and restoring lands and water degraded by mining operations before 1977.</p>

          <ul>Title IV of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) shapes two of OSMRE’s major programs:
            <li>Protecting the environment by regulating coal mines: OSMRE regulates coal mining operations so that they are conducted in an environmentally responsible manner, and that the land is adequately reclaimed during and following the mining process.</li>
            <li>Restoring the environment by reclaiming abandoned mine lands: OSMRE’s Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation Program addresses the physical hazards from abandoned mines, and promotes the vitality of surrounding communities.
