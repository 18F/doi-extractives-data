            <p>The 1978 OCSLA amendment required BOEM to develop offshore land-use plans in the Five Year Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Program, designed to meet national energy needs from oil and gas while balancing economic, environmental, and social considerations. Under this program, BOEM also creates a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), to evaluate the effects of the extractive processes on the quality of the human environment.</p>
            <p>Each five year program contains a schedule of lease sales for that period. The public has the opportunity to comment on the proposed leasing program; public comments are submitted, along with the plan, to Congress and the President.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">

          <p>Once the Five Year Program is in place, BOEM begins planning for each regional lease sale, a one to two year process, including developing a site-specific Environmental Impact Statement with opportunities for public comment. BOEM will send a notice of sale to interested bidders with the terms and conditions of the “blocks,” nine square mile areas, to be offered.</p>

          <p>The bidding process is competitive, meaning that any oil and gas company may participate. BOEM offers leases through a sealed process. The apparent winner—the bidder with the highest offer—is subject to BOEM’s subsequent <a href="http://www.boem.gov/Fair-Market-Value/">fair market value analysis</a>, and will only receive the lease if the bid meets or exceeds the fair market value of the resources on the block in question as calculated by BOEM. BOEM calculates fair market value based on the expected value of exploring for and extracting oil and gas resources from that block—not based on actual activities and discoveries resulting from the sale of the lease.</p>

        <h3 class="revenues_subpage-steps_heading">Explore</h3>
        <button class="accordion-button" accordion-button></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>During the explore phase, the lease holder must file an exploration plan (EP) with the BOEM in order to explore the leased land for oil and gas deposits. The BOEM defines exploration as “the process of searching for minerals preliminary to development. Exploration activities include: (1) geophysical surveys, (2) any drilling to locate an oil or gas reservoir, and (3) the drilling of additional wells after a discovery to delineate a reservoir. It enables the lessee to determine whether to proceed with development and production.” Companies must submit an EP detailing all planned exploration activities, including timing, location of wells, method, potential environmental impact, and potential environmental impact in the worst-case blowout scenario. The BOEM evaluates the EP and determines if extenuating circumstances require the lease holder to complete a site-specific environmental assessment (SEA) before proceeding.</p>
          <p>The BOEM will grant an exploratory lease ranging from five to ten years based on water depth and adversity of conditions. During the exploration period, companies pay rent on the leased or claimed land to the federal government, collected by the ONRR. Companies can choose whether or not to extend their leases based on their findings during exploration.</p>

        <button class="accordion-button" accordion-button></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Once a lease has been awarded, the lease holder must develop and submit an Exploration Plan and a Development or Production Plan for BOEM’s approval. Once approval has been granted, the lease holder or operator may begin the process of exploring for oil and gas. If these resources are found, the lease holder will apply to BSEE for drilling and operations permits to begin extraction.</p>
          <p>During this phase, BSEE oversees development of natural resources and enforces lease terms and other conditions. BSEE will also conduct initial inspections to ensure the proper installation of structures and equipment, as well as periodic announced and unannounced inspections throughout the operation.</p>
          <p>During the development of the natural resource, the lease holder pays annual rent specified in the lease, until the operation starts producing oil or gas in paying quantities, at which time the lease holder stops paying rent and begins paying a royalty. The Office of Natural Resources Revenues collects both payments.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>At the close of an operation, the lease holder or operator must return the ocean and seafloor to its pre-lease condition. BOEM requires that retired offshore drilling platforms be removed from the marine environment within one year. Under the OCSLA regulations, the lease holder is required to submit a decommissioning plan two years prior to the termination of the lease to BSEE for approval. To satisfy NEPA obligations, BOEM prepares a site-specific Environmental Assessment for each removal application on behalf of BSEE.</p>
          <p>The lease holder is required to remove the platform from its foundation by severing all bottom-founded components at least 15 feet below the mudline, and disposing of the structures in a scrap yard or fabrication yard. Alternatively, the platform can be permitted to create an artificial reef underwater.</p>
