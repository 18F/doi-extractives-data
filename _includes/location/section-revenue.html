  <h2>Revenue</h2>

  <p>Companies pay a wide range of fees, rates, and taxes to extract natural resources in the U.S. The types and amounts of payments differ, depending on who owns the natural resources. Payments are often called &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; because they represent revenue to the American public.</p>

    <h3>Federal revenue</h3>

    <p>
      Natural resource extraction can lead to federal revenue in two ways: non-tax revenue and tax revenue. Most USEITI data is about non-tax revenue from extractive industry activities on federal land.

    <p>Laws and policies govern how rights are awarded to companies and what they pay to extract natural resources on federal land. For details, read more about the processes for awarding rights and collecting revenue for each kind of resource: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/coal/">coal</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/onshore-oil-gas/">oil and gas</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/onshore-renewables/">renewable resources</a>, and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/minerals/">hardrock minerals</a>.</p>

    <p>The federal government collects different kinds of fees at each phase of natural resource extraction. This chart shows how much federal revenue was collected in {{ year}} for production or potential production of natural resources on federal land in {{ state_name }}, broken down by phase of production.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Individuals and corporations (specifically C-corporations) pay income taxes to the IRS. Depending on company income, federal corporate income tax rates can range from 15â€“35%. Public policy provisions, such as tax expenditures, can decrease corporate income tax and other revenue payments in order to romote other policy goals.</p>
