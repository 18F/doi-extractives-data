  <h3>Federal disbursements</h2>

  <p>After collecting revenue from natural resource extraction, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue distributes that money to different agencies, funds, and local governments for public use. This process is called &ldquo;disbursement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>
    Most federal revenue goes to the General Fund of the Treasury, infrastructure and operational funds, and funds that support public works. While these disbursements are tracked <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/explore/#federal-disbursements">nationally</a>, we don't have detailed data that specifies which expenditures and projects from those national funds are in {{ state_name }}.
