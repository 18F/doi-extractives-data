  <h2>Disbursements</h2>
  <p>After collecting revenue, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) distributes it to different agencies, funds, and local governments through a process called &ldquo;disbursement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>About 38% of revenue from onshore natural resource extraction on federal land is disbursed to state governments. For offshore revenue, from natural resource extraction on the Outer Continental Shelf, less than 1% of revenue is disbursed to state governments.</p>
