<section id="overview">

  <p>USEITI reporting includes data about extractive industries in each state. This page summarizes information from the USEITI reporting process about natural resources in {{ state_name }} and what role extractive industries play in the state economy.</p>

<!--   <p>The USEITI Multi-Stakeholder Group identified {{ state_name }} as a priority state, so this page also includes state legal and fiscal information.</p>
  <p>To learn more about communities in {{ state_name }} with significant extractive activity, see case studies.</p>
  <p>{{ state_name }} has opted into USEITI sub-national reporting, so this page also includes information about extractive industries activity on state-owned land.</p> -->
