    <h1>How do natural resources become<br/> Federal revenue?</h1>
    <p>If there are natural resources under (or even suspected of being under) Federal lands, the U.S. Department of the Interior grants leases to companies to explore for and extract these products to be sold.</p>
    <p>In return, part of the sales value is paid to the Federal government for the benefit of the American people. These are called “royalties.” There are other revenues involved, such as rents, fees, and penalties, but by far most of the money comes from these royalties.</p>
