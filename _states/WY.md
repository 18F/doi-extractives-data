    The state government of Wyoming administers 3.4 million surface acres of land (about 5.5% of the state) and 3.9 million mineral acres. For detailed information about land ownership in each county, see the [Wyoming Statewide Parcel Viewer](http://gis.wyo.gov/parcels/).
state_land_production: |
    In FY 2014, 29.3 million short tons of surface-mined coal and 2.4 million short tons of underground-mined coal were extracted on state lands in Wyoming.

    For details about natural resource extraction on state-owned land, see annual reports produced by the [Office of State Lands and Investments](http://lands.wyo.gov/minerals).
state_revenue: |
    Revenue from natural resource extraction on federal, state, and private land is a primary source of income for the state of Wyoming.
state_revenue_sustainability: |
    In 2014, natural resource revenue streams contributed almost half of the state’s total general fund revenues. Over the last decade, Wyoming’s general fund revenues from extractive industries have doubled from $315 million to $640 million, and the percentage of total general fund revenues from extraction has increased 8%, fluctuating between a low of 33% (in 2009) and a high of 46% (in 2014). Severance tax revenues hold particular importance for Wyoming, accounting for between up to a quarter of general fund revenues.

    To read more about the impact of revenue from the extractive industries on Wyoming’s general fund, including future projections, see reports produced by Wyoming's [Consensus Revenue Estimating Group](http://eadiv.state.wy.us/creg/creg.html).

<!-- State governance -->

### State agencies

The state of Wyoming regulates extraction and interacts with extractive industry companies in Montana, particularly when they're operating on state or private land.

The [Wyoming Department of Revenue](http://revenue.wyo.gov/) assesses, collects, manages, and distributes revenue from companies engaged in extraction of oil, natural gas, coal, and other natural resources in Wyoming. At the local level, gounty governments directly collect ad valorem taxes related to extraction. The Department of Revenue is governed by [rules and regulations](http://revenue.wyo.gov/home/rules-and-regulations-by-chapter) and publishes annual [Mineral Tax Distribution reports](http://revenue.wyo.gov/tax-distribution-reports/mineral-tax-distributions). 

The [Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission](http://wogcc.state.wy.us/) ensures that oil and gas wells and operations comply with state environmental laws, as well as regulating mining activities on state land. It publishes [rules and regulations](http://wogcc.state.wy.us/wogcchelp/commission.html), and its activities include:

* Permitting all oil and gas wells
* Maintaining well records
* Performing field inspections
* Performing orphan well plugging
* Holding reclamation bonds on mine operations

The [Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments](http://lands.wyo.gov/home) leases, controls, and collects royalties from mineral extraction on state trust land. Publications include:

* An [annual report (PDF)](http://slf-web.state.wy.us/osli/Reports/BusinessPlanFY15.pdf)
* Information on leasing procedures, rental policy, and royalties for [specific mineral resources](http://lands.wyo.gov/minerals)

The [Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality](http://deq.wyoming.gov/) (DEQ) leads activities to conserve the environment and support responsible stewardship of Wyoming’s resources. DEQ’s permitting process covers all activities associated with mining, from exploration to reclamation commitments.

* The [Air Quality Division](http://deq.wyoming.gov/aqd/) issues air quality permits, particularly in the Upper Green River Basin.
* The [Water Quality Division](http://deq.wyoming.gov/wqd/) works to ensure the proper disposal of wastewater, and monitors water quality. It also permits underground injections of wastewater, reclaims discharge impoundments related to coal bed methane production, and works with the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission and Land Quality Division to regulate underground wastewater injection through the [Underground Injection Control Program](http://deq.wyoming.gov/wqd/underground-injection-control/). The Water Quality Division also maintains its own list of [rules and regulations](http://deq.wyoming.gov/wqd/resources/rules-regs/).
* The [Solid and Hazardous Waste Division](http://deq.wyoming.gov/shwd/) inspects hazardous waste storage and disposal.
* The [Land Quality Division](http://deq.wyoming.gov/lqd/) regulates surface mining operations and surface operations for underground mines, works to ensure reclamation following mining, establishes reclamation bond amounts, and holds reclamation bonds on mine operations. It publishes an [annual report (PDF)](http://deq.wyoming.gov/media/uploads/admin/annual_report_2014.pdf) that includes bond amounts.
* The [Abandoned Mine Land Division](http://deq.wyoming.gov/aml/) administers the federal AML program for coal and select hardrock reclamation projects.

The [Wyoming State Geological Survey](http://www.wsgs.wyo.gov/) also provides geological information about natural resources. 

### State laws and regulations

Wyoming’s constitution includes an [article governing mining](http://legisweb.state.wy.us/NXT/gateway.dll/2016%20Wyoming%20Statutes/2016%20Constitution/1/10?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=Publish:10.1048/Enu).

The [Wyoming Statutes Annotated](http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/wystatutes/) have several sections that govern natural resource extraction, including:

* Title 30: Mines and Minerals
* Title 39: Taxation (including ad valorem taxes and the Mine Product Tax)
* Title 36: State Lands (including mineral leasing)
* Title 35, Chapter 11 (from the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act): Air, water, and land quality, as well as abandoned mine land reclamation and orphan site remediation (see articles 2-4, 12, and 17)

Wyoming rules and regulations are maintained by the Office of the Secretary of State, which publishes a [rules search tool](http://soswy.state.wy.us/Rules/default.aspx) for finding rules by department or topic.

### Fiscal costs of extractive activity

In addition to generating revenue, extractive industries can bring costs to state and local communities.

Depending on the state, differences in revenue collection between states and counties can illuminate state distribution of those funds to counties to help them address those costs. 

In Wyoming, analysis of those costs has centered on **Campbell County** (coal production) and **Sublette County** (oil & gas production):

* The USEITI case study on [Campbell County](../../case-studies/campbell/) provides a holistic look at the impact of extractive industries in the northeastern part of the state.
* Most information about socioeconomic impacts in Sublette County and its municipalities comes from the [2009 Sublette County Socioeconomic Impact Study (PDF)](http://www.sublettewyo.com/DocumentCenter/Home/View/392). This report, which was commissioned by Sublette County Commissioners, focuses on whether revenues returned to and retained by Sublette County are sufficient to balance the fiscal costs of extractive activity in the county, rather than whether enough state or local taxes are paid by the companies participating in extraction.

The USEITI {{ "Multi-Stakeholder Group" | term:"Multi-Stakeholder Group (MSG)" }} prioritized four types of fiscal costs:

#### Transportation

In the [2010 Campbell County Coal Belt Transportation Study (PDF)](https://www.ccgov.net/DocumentCenter/Home/View/1910), Campbell County and the Wyoming Department of Transportation estimated that **county roads would require $43.9 million in investment** between 2010 and 2015 to support coal extraction.

Traffic increased 86% in Sublette County and its municipalities from 2000 to 2007, largely due to natural resource extraction. In 2009, they estimated that **projected road improvement projects would total $87.5 million** from 2009 to 2012 and beyond. The self-contained nature of large coal mining operations in Sublette County contributes to higher transportation costs compared to Campbell County.

#### Water

In Sublette County, natural resource extraction has led to population growth, which has increased demands on existing water systems. The town of Marbleton also drilled an additional water well to provide domestic and commercial water due to increased demand.

See [state agencies](#state-agencies) for information about statewide water management.

#### Emergency services

Population growth due to increased natural resource extraction can increase demands on the medical, fire, and police services of states, counties, and towns.

Prior to 2001, the Sublette County Rural Health Care District had two all-volunteer Emergency Medical Services (EMS) units. By 2006, the district had hired 25 full-time emergency medical technicians. From 2001 to 2007, EMS runs increased 116% for the Pinedale facility and 94.47% for the Marbleton-Big Piney facility. To serve the Jonah gas field and the South Anticline, the district built a new EMS facility in 2007 at Sand Draw. Local industry paid for $900,000 of the cost of the facility, with the county paying $500,000. 

#### Reclamation

Wyoming has been “certified” by the federal Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation program, meaning it has reclaimed its identified high-priority abandoned coal mine areas. It also means AML funds, which are sourced from fees paid by coal mine operators, can be used for a wider range of purposes beyond reclamation, including abandoned hardrock mine sites. The program currently estimates that Wyoming has $52 million in unreclaimed coal AML sites and $686,000 in unreclaimed non-coal AML sites (such as uranium mining sites). To learn more about recently completed projects and projects underway, search for Wyoming Annual Evaluation Reports in the [OSMRE Oversight Document Database](http://odocs.osmre.gov/). 

See [state agencies](#state-agencies) for additional statewide reclamation activities.
