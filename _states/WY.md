### State agencies

The state of Wyoming regulates extraction and interacts with extractive industry companies in Montana, particularly when they're operating on state or private land.

The [Wyoming Department of Revenue](http://revenue.wyo.gov/) assesses, collects, manages, and distributes revenue from companies engaged in extraction of oil, natural gas, coal, and other natural resources in Wyoming. It publishes annual [Mineral Tax Distribution reports](http://revenue.wyo.gov/tax-distribution-reports/mineral-tax-distributions).

The [Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission](http://wogcc.state.wy.us/) ensures that oil and gas wells and operations comply with state environmental laws. It is governed by [rules and regulations](http://wogcc.state.wy.us/rules-statutes.cfm?Skip=%27Y%27), and its activities include:

* Permitting all oil and gas wells
* Maintaining well records
* Performing field inspections
* Performing orphan well plugging
* Holding reclamation bonds on mine operations

The [Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments](http://lands.wyo.gov/home) leases, controls, and collects royalties from mineral extraction on state trust land. (Once under lease, mining activities on state land is regulated by the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission and Department of Environmental Quality.) The Office of State Lands and Investments publishes annual reports and commodity- and mineral-specific pages on leasing procedures, rental policy, and other information. 

The [Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality](http://deq.wyoming.gov/) (DEQ) leads activities to conserve the environment and support responsible stewardship of Wyoming’s resources. DEQ’s permitting process covers all activities associated with mining, from exploration to reclamation commitments.

* The Air Quality Division issues air quality permits, particularly in the Upper Green River Basin.
* The [Water Quality Division](http://deq.wyoming.gov/wqd/) works to ensure the proper disposal of wastewater, and monitors water quality. It also permits underground injections of wastewater, reclaims discharge impoundments related to coal bed methane production, and works with the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission and Land Quality Division to regulate underground wastewater injection through the [Underground Injection Control Program](http://deq.wyoming.gov/wqd/underground-injection-control/).
* The Solid and Hazardous Waste Division inspects hazardous waste storage and disposal.
* Land Quality Division regulates surface mining operations and surface operations for underground mines, works to ensure reclamation following mining, and establishes reclamation bond amounts and holds reclamation bonds on mine operations (to see details on bond amounts as of 2014, click here).
* The Abandoned Mine Land Division administers the federal AML program for coal and select hardrock reclamation projects.
