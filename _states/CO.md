state_land: |
  The state of Colorado covers over 66.5 million acres. The state is the owner and steward of 2.8 million acres of land and 4 million acres of mineral rights. In total, it owns 4% of land in Colorado, making it the state’s second-largest landowner, just behind the federal government.
state_land_production: |
  The state of Colorado does not publish data about natural resource production on state lands. To obtain this data, contact the [Colorado State Land Board](https://colorado.gov/statelandboard).
state_revenue: |
  State and local governments in Colorado collect or receive revenue from natural resource extraction on federal, state, and private lands.
state_revenue_sustainability: |
  In FY2016, natural resource revenue accounted for 0.89% of total revenue collected by the Colorado Department of Revenue. Colorado has a diverse set of revenue streams; however, the downturn of oil and gas markets in 2016 did have a substantial impact on certain government funds. The State Land Board, for example, saw its total trust revenue decrease by 28% due to a 35% decrease in mineral revenues.
state_tax_expenditures: |
  In FY2015, Colorado had 15 tax expenditures directly related to the extractive industries which reduced state and local revenue. Data on the exact revenue impact for all expenditures is largely unavailable due to confidentiality requirements or inability to collect that information, however, the Oil and Gas Ad Valorem Credit had an impact of $134,915,000. The Colorado Department of Revenue outlines tax expenditures in its annual [Tax Profile and Expenditure Report (PDF)](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/2016%20Tax%20Profile%20and%20Expenditure%20Report.pdf).
state_disbursements: |
  State agencies distribute revenue according to the [Colorado State Code](https://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/Welcome.do). In addition to receiving distributions from the state, counties also collect and distribute revenue from local taxes, chiefly property taxes. Weld County, for example, produces the most oil and gas in the state, and generates a signification portion of its property tax revenue from oil and gas. It then disburses this revenue to help fund local schools, fire departments, libraries, towns, and water districts, among other items. For more details on how Weld County disburses property tax revenue see the county’s [distribution statements and treasurer reports](https://www.weldgov.com/cms/One.aspx?portalId=169&pageId=2451).
state_saving_spending: |
  Many states choose to establish permanent mineral trust funds, which can help governments smooth revenue and investments across boom and bust cycles. In FY2016, Colorado saved 28.05% of total state revenue from extractive activities. In a given year, most of Colorado’s saved extractive revenues goes to one of these funds:

  * **Local Government Permanent Fund**: Money in this fund cannot be used for any purpose except when the amount of Federal Mineral Lease revenue is 10% less than the amount received the previous year.
  * **Higher Education Maintenance and Reserve Fund**: The interest and income earned on this fund is used for maintenance projects controlled by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education’s Capital Improvements Program. The principal in this fund must remain unused unless General Fund revenue is projected to dip below the required 4% reserve.
  * **School Trust Permanent Fund**: Colorado created this fund at statehood. Interest generated on the principal must support K-12 education. Interest earnings of the fund are credited to the Public School Income Fund and transferred to the Colorado Department of Education.

  See the [Memorandum on Allocation of Severance Taxes (PDF)](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/Allocation%20of%20Severance%20Taxes.pdf) or [Public School Permanent Fund Investment Policy (PDF)](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/atoms/files/Public%20School%20Permanent%20Fund%202010%20Investment%20Policy%20-%20Approved%20March%2015%202017.pdf) for more detail.

### State agencies

The state of Colorado regulates an array of activities related to natural resource extraction and interacts with the extractive industries, especially when the activity is occurring on state or private land.

The Colorado Department of Revenue collects, manages, and distributes revenue from companies engaged in extraction in Colorado. It publishes annual [summary](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/annual-report) , expenditure, and severance tax reports. Additionally, county governments collect oil and gas related property taxes, with the Colorado Department of Local Affairs’ Division of Property Taxation coordinating this process.

The [Colorado Department of Natural Resources](http://dnr.state.co.us/Pages/DNRDefault.aspx) manages the state’s natural resources and administers [state trust lands](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/statelandboard).

* The Colorado [Oil and Gas Conservation Commission](http://cogcc.state.co.us/#/home) ensures that oil and gas wells and operations comply with state law. It is involved in all stages of extraction—issuing exploration permits, auctioning leases, addressing incidents/complaints, enforcing rules and regulations, collecting levies, etc. The commission is governed by [rules and regulations](http://cogcc.state.co.us/#/overview), runs a [data portal](http://cogcc.state.co.us/data.html#/cogis), and publishes reports.
* The [Division of Reclamation, Mining, and Safety](http://mining.state.co.us/Pages/Home.aspx) works to protect the public, miners, and the environment during current mining operations. It holds responsibility for restoring abandoned mines and ensuring that all mined land is reclaimed to beneficial use. It works to achieve these goals through four major programs: coal regulatory program, minerals regulatory program, inactive mine reclamation program, and mine safety and training program. The commission is governed by [rules and regulations](http://mining.state.co.us/Rules/Pages/home.aspx), runs a data portal, and publishes reports.

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment(CDPHE) plays a role in regulating oil and gas operations. CDPHE deals primarily with:
* Air emission requirements for the oil and gas industry
* Water quality and stormwater discharge permits for oil and gas facilities
* Hazardous, radioactive, and solid waste requirements affecting oil and gas facilities
* Climate change and greenhouse gases through mandatory reporting rules, reports, and presentations
* Public health effects from oil and gas operations through reporting, community investigations, and assessments
