    For a detailed view of how oil extraction affects communities in Alaska, read more about [North Slope Borough](/case-studies/north-slope/).

state_production: |
    Most of Alaska's crude oil production takes place in the [North Slope Borough](../../case-studies/north-slope/), where exploration, drilling, and transportation costs are high, but high volume and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline make commercial drilling feasible.

    About three-fourths of Alaska's natural gas withdrawals are consumed on site after extraction, because it is not commercially feasible to transport to distant markets. For more information about the Alaska Natural Gas pipeline, see the [congressional report (PDF)](http://www.ferc.gov/legal/staff-reports/2016/angta-twenty-first.pdf). 

    **Nonenergy minerals:** For details about nonenergy mineral extraction, see the [USGS Minerals Yearbook for Alaska](http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/state/ak.html).

    In 2012, Alaska's nonenergy mineral production was valued at about $3.69 billion. Metals, including gold, made up 98% of Alaska’s nonenergy mineral production value in 2012. Alaska produces 14% of U.S. gold, with major gold mines in central Alaska, southern Alaska, and the Seward Peninsula. More information about gold exploration can be found [here](http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/gold/).

state_revenue: |
    Alaska collects a significant amount of revenue from natural resource extraction on state, federal, and private lands and waters.

state_tax_expenditures: |
    Alaska had four tax expenditures claimed in 2015 that were directly related to oil and gas extraction and totaled at least $1 million each. Together, these four tax expenditures reduced state or local revenue by a total of $1.3 billion. The expenditure credits and per taxable barrel credits each accounted for 46% of total expenditures, at $590 million and $595 million respectively. The Alaska Department of Revenue outlines tax expenditures in its [Revenue Sources Book (PDF)](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/documentviewer/viewer.aspx?1240r). 
state_disbursements: |
state_saving_spending: |
    The state of Alaska saves about 32% of royalties and 25% of production taxes. (Royalties, production taxes, and property taxes are Alaska’s three largest sources of revenue from natural resource extraction.)

    While some saved revenue may be utilized for state operations in a budget shortfall, the fund retains the vast majority of the capital. Most of Alaska’s saved revenue goes to one of the funds detailed below.
state_impact: |
    The extractive industries play an important role in Alaska’s economy. Pipeline transportation and construction also contribute significantly; in 2014, pipeline transportation contributed $4.1 billion to Alaska's GDP.   

    Because of relatively high annual wages (compared to other industries), extractive industries contribute a greater percentage of personal income than jobs. In 2015, annual wages from extractive industries made up about 13% (or $2.3 billion) of total annual wages in the state. The average annual wage for extractive-industry jobs in Alaska in 2015 was $113,949, or more than twice the statewide average wage of $54,762.

### State agencies

Alaska state agencies regulate extraction and interact with extractive industry companies in Alaska, particularly when they're operating on state or private land.

The [Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission](http://doa.alaska.gov/ogc/WhoWeAre/welcome.html) leads monitoring, enforcement, and restoration activities to support responsible stewardship of Alaska’s oil and gas resources. Its responsibilities include:

* Evaluating and approving drilling operations
* Preventing oil and gas waste at drill sites where the majority of natural gas extraction is flared
* Preventing freshwater contamination throughout drilling
* Administering Alaska’s Underground Injection Control Program
* Inspecting oil field drilling, projecting, metering, and abandonment activities
* Publishing a [competitiveness report](http://dor.alaska.gov/Portals/5/Alaska's%20Oil%20and%20Gas%20Competitiveness%20Report%202015.pdf) and [annual reports](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/programs/reports/AnnualReport.aspx?Year=2015)

The [Alaska Department of Natural Resources](http://dnr.alaska.gov/) manages Alaska's natural resources and extraction on state land.

The [Division of Oil and Gas](http://dog.dnr.alaska.gov/) is responsible for leasing state lands for oil, gas, and geothermal extraction. It publishes [annual reports](http://dog.dnr.alaska.gov/Publications/AnnualReports.htm), and its activities include:

* Identifying prospective lease areas; evaluating oil and gas resources; and performing geologic, economic, environmental, and social analyses
* Fielding and issuing exploration permits, developing leasing schedules, and conducting public review of proposed sales
* Conducting oil and gas lease sales, negotiating contracts, and conducting royalty audits
* Decommissioning and restoration activities, including [Decommissioning, Removal, and Restoration Regulatory Review (PDF)](http://dog.dnr.alaska.gov/publications/Documents/OtherReports/DRR-ArcadisReport-20141128.pdf), which details conservation efforts related to drilling infrastructure
- Publishing statutes and regulations governing [oil and gas](http://dog.dnr.alaska.gov/AboutUs/OGStatutes.htm) and [geothermal](http://dog.dnr.alaska.gov/AboutUs/GeothermalStatutes.htm)
- Publishing data about [oil and gas funds received and distributed](http://dog.dnr.alaska.gov/Royalty/Funds.htm#received)

The [Mining, Land, and Water Division](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/) is the primary manager of Alaska’s land holdings, which are larger by area than any other state, and Alaska's mineral resources (excluding oil, gas, coalbed methane, and geothermal energy). It is responsible for:

* Managing state mineral exploration, development and leasing programs on 96 million acres of state lands available for exploration
* Planning, leasing, and permitting industrial use mines
* Administering the [Surface Coal Mining Control and Reclamation Program](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/coal/)
* Administering the [Abandoned Mine Land Program](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/aml/), which regulates surface mines and mining reclamation activities (in 2014, there were 23 sites awaiting reclamation)
* Overseeing major land development project authorizations like the North Slope
* Publishing information on [Public Land Titles](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/title/index.cfm) and [State Land Sales](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/landsale/index.cfm)
* Publishing Alaska’s [mineral development policies (PDF)](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/AK_MineralPolicy.pdf), [mining factsheets](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/factsht/), and [mining regulations](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/sb175.pdf)

The [Alaska Department of Revenue](http://dor.alaska.gov/) assesses, collects, manages, and distributes the majority of extractives revenues in Alaska.

The [Alaska Department of Revenue](http://dor.alaska.gov/) collects revenue from companies engaged in extraction, with verification from the Oil and Gas Division, and publishes an [Annual Report](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/programs/reports/AnnualReport.aspx?Year=2015) and [Revenue Sources Book (PDF)](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/documentviewer/viewer.aspx?1240r).

* The [Alaska Department of Revenue Tax Division](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/) collects state taxes, including the Oil and Gas Production Tax and Oil and Gas Property Tax, and administers tax laws.

  - [Revenue sources and forecast information](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/sourcebook/index.aspx)

The Environmental Conservation’s Program [Spill Prevention and Response Division](http://dec.alaska.gov/spar/index.htm) (SPAR) prevents spills of oil, prepares for when a spill occurs, and responds rapidly to protect human health and the environment.

### Fiscal costs of extractive activity

In addition to generating [revenue](#revenue) and [economic activity](#economic-impact), extractive industries can bring costs to state and local communities.

The USEITI [case study on the North Slope Borough](../../case-studies/north-slope/) provides a holistic look at the impact of oil and gas production in the northern part of the state.

The USEITI {{ "Multi-Stakeholder Group" | term:"Multi-Stakeholder Group (MSG)" }} prioritized four types of fiscal costs:

#### Transportation



#### Water



#### Emergency services



#### Reclamation
