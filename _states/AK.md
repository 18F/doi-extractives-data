    For a detailed view of how oil extraction affects communities in Alaska, read more about [North Slope Borough](/case-studies/north-slope/).

state_production: |
    Most of Alaska's crude oil production takes place in the [North Slope Borough](../../case-studies/north-slope/), where exploration, drilling, and transportation costs are high, but high volume and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline make commercial drilling feasible.

    About three-fourths of Alaska's natural gas withdrawals are consumed on site after extraction, because it is not commercially feasible to transport to distant markets. For more information about the Alaska Natural Gas pipeline, see the [congressional report (PDF)](http://www.ferc.gov/legal/staff-reports/2016/angta-twenty-first.pdf). 

    **Nonenergy minerals:** For details about nonenergy mineral extraction, see the [USGS Minerals Yearbook for Alaska](http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/state/ak.html).

    In 2012, Alaska's nonenergy mineral production was valued at about $3.69 billion. Metals, including gold, made up 98% of Alaska’s nonenergy mineral production value in 2012. Alaska produces 14% of U.S. gold, with major gold mines in central Alaska, southern Alaska, and the Seward Peninsula. More information about gold exploration can be found [here](http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/gold/).

state_revenue: |
    Alaska collects a significant amount of revenue from natural resource extraction on state, federal, and private lands and waters.

state_tax_expenditures: |
    Alaska had four tax expenditures claimed in 2015 that were directly related to oil and gas extraction and totaled at least $1 million each. Together, these four tax expenditures reduced state or local revenue by a total of $1.3 billion. The expenditure credits and per taxable barrel credits each accounted for 46% of total expenditures, at $590 million and $595 million respectively. The Alaska Department of Revenue outlines tax expenditures in its [Revenue Sources Book (PDF)](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/documentviewer/viewer.aspx?1240r). 
state_disbursements: |
state_saving_spending: |
    The state of Alaska saves about 32% of royalties and 25% of production taxes. (Royalties, production taxes, and property taxes are Alaska’s three largest sources of revenue from natural resource extraction.)

    While some saved revenue may be utilized for state operations in a budget shortfall, the fund retains the vast majority of the capital. Most of Alaska’s saved revenue goes to one of the funds detailed below.
state_impact: |
    The extractive industries play an important role in Alaska’s economy. Pipeline transportation and construction also contribute significantly; in 2014, pipeline transportation contributed $4.1 billion to Alaska's GDP.   

    Because of relatively high annual wages (compared to other industries), extractive industries contribute a greater percentage of personal income than jobs. In 2015, annual wages from extractive industries made up about 13% (or $2.3 billion) of total annual wages in the state. The average annual wage for extractive-industry jobs in Alaska in 2015 was $113,949, or more than twice the statewide average wage of $54,762.

### State agencies

Alaska state agencies collect, manage, and distribute revenue from the extractive industries; enforce rules and regulations associated with extraction; and manage state-owned land and natural resources.

Alaska state agencies regulate extraction and interact with industry across the five stages of extraction in Alaska, particularly on state and private lands. On federal lands, state agencies will be involved, but to a lesser extent, as federal agencies hold primary responsibility for managing the land. To learn how extraction occurs on federal land, see the federal “How it Works” section for more information.

The Alaska Department of Administration’s [Oil and Gas Conservation Commission](http://doa.alaska.gov/ogc/WhoWeAre/welcome.html) leads Alaska’s monitoring, enforcement, and restoration activities to support responsible stewardship of Alaska’s oil and gas resources.

The Alaska [Oil and Gas Conservation Commission](http://doa.alaska.gov/ogc/WhoWeAre/welcome.html) evaluates and approves drilling operations while preventing oil and gas waste at drill sites where the majority of natural gas extraction is flared. The Commission is responsible for preventing freshwater contamination throughout drilling and administers Alaska’s Underground Injection Control Program. The Commission is the primary body responsible for inspecting oil field drilling, projecting, metering and abandonment activities. 

The Department of Natural Resources’ (DNR) [Oil and Gas Division](http://dog.dnr.alaska.gov/) manages planning, permitting, leasing for oil and gas development and monitors collection of all funds resulting from oil and gas extraction. It also participates in decommissioning and restoration.

The DNR’s Oil and Gas Division develops and manages the state’s oil and gas leasing programs. The Oil and Gas division identifies prospective lease areas, performs geologic, economic, environmental and social analyses, develops leasing schedules, conducts public review of proposed sales, and conducts oil and gas lease sales. The Oil and Gas Division’s [Annual Reports](http://dog.dnr.alaska.gov/Publications/AnnualReports.htm) and [Decommissioning, Removal, and Restoration Regulatory Review (PDF)](http://dog.dnr.alaska.gov/publications/Documents/OtherReports/DRR-ArcadisReport-20141128.pdf), which details conservation efforts related to drilling infrastructure, are available online. 

The DNR’s [Mining, Land and Water Division](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/) manages Alaska’s land holdings and minerals excluding oil, gas, coalbed methane, and geothermal. The Division is responsible for planning, leasing, permitting, exploration, and development as well as administration of the [Surface Coal Mining Control and Reclamation Program](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/coal/) and the [Abandoned Mine Land Program](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/aml/).

The DNR’s [Mining, Land and Water Division](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/) is the primary manager of Alaska’s land holdings, which are larger by area than any other state. The Division handles planning, leasing and permitting, as well as oversees major land development project authorizations like the North Slope. Information on [Public Land Titles](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/title/index.cfm) and [State Land Sales](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/landsale/index.cfm) is available online.

DNR’s [Abandoned Mine Land Program](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/aml/) is the group responsible for regulating surface mines and mining reclamation activities. In 2014, there were 23 sites awaiting reclamation.

The DNR’s [Mining, Land and Water Division](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/) manages all mineral resources except oil, gas and coalbed methane. It manages state mineral exploration, development and leasing programs on 96 million acres of state lands available for exploration. The Division is responsible for planning, leasing, permitting industrial use mines. Alaska’s [Mineral Development Policies (PDF)](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/AK_MineralPolicy.pdf) and [Mining Factsheets](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/factsht/) are available online.

The [Alaska Department of Revenue](http://dor.alaska.gov/) assesses, collects, manages, and distributes the majority of extractives revenues in Alaska.

The [Alaska Department of Revenue](http://dor.alaska.gov/) collects revenue from companies engaged in extraction with verification from the Oil and Gas Division. The [Annual Report](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/programs/reports/AnnualReport.aspx?Year=2015) and [Revenue Sources Book (PDF)](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/documentviewer/viewer.aspx?1240r) provide greater detail.

The Environmental Conservation’s Program [Spill Prevention and Response Division](http://dec.alaska.gov/spar/index.htm) (SPAR) prevents spills of oil, prepares for when a spill occurs and responds rapidly to protect human health and the environment.
