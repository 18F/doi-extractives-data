    <h1>Disbursements</h1>

    <p>Once collected, the federal government distributes revenue from natural resource extraction for public use in a variety of ways. Federal corporate income taxes go to the General Fund of the Treasury, and Congress determines how to allocate these resources each year through the appropriations process.</p>

    <p>In comparison, DOI revenue from extraction on federal lands goes to many different funds and entities. In FY 2013, ONRR disbursed $14.187 billion in DOI revenue. The recipient of these funds depends on whether the revenue is derived from onshore or offshore natural resource extraction.</p>
