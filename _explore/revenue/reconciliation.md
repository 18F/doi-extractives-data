  <p>As a part of USEITI, companies report payments to the government (e.g., rents, taxes, royalties) and the government reports what it received. These figures are compiled and reconciled by an independent administrator and published. In the future, this dataset will be interactive. For now, you can learn about the reconciliation process or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/">download the dataset</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>Reconciliation results</h3>
  
  <p>When the independent administrator compared company payments to government revenue, 17 discrepancies exceeded the margin of variance. The independent administrator worked with the companies and government entities to investigate these discrepancies, and was able to find explanations for all of them. Explanations included differences in when payments were recorded and how they were classified.</p>
  
  <p>Of the 45 companies that were asked to participate, 31 reported DOI revenue and 11 reported federal corporate income taxes.</p>

  <p>Five companies also allowed for corporate income tax reconciliation: BP America; Cimarex Energy Co.; Could Peak Energy Resources, LLC; Shell E&P Company; and W&T Offshore, Inc.</p>
    
  <p>After the independent administrator compared and reconciled the government revenue streams with company payments, 17 material variances remained, all of which were explained through the reconciliation process, leaving zero unexplained variances.</p>
