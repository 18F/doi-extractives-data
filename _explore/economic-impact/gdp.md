  <p>Extractive industries affect the economy in a number of ways, including the quantity and value of the natural resources produced, the revenue collected for public purposes, the jobs held by people working in extractive industries, and the exports that draw in money from abroad. While it can be difficult to quantify an industry’s impact on a country, these measures—production, revenue, employment, and exports—start to highlight the extractive industries’ role in the economy.</p>
