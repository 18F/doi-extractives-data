      <h2>Twelve county narratives</h2>

      <p>While extractive industry makes up a small but important part of the national economy in the U.S. (2.6% of 2013 GDP), in some communities, extractive industry plays a much larger role. From copper pits set deep in Arizona’s hills to oil wells in Alaska’s North Borough, resource extraction has helped shape local history, culture, and economy. The growth and development of these communities has long fluctuated with the booms and busts of the global commodities <a href="#test" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">market.</a></p>

      <p><a href="#beta" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">Using publicly available data,</a> the following narratives provide a snapshot into twelve communities that, over approximately the last decade, have led U.S. counties in production of one of the following resources: iron, copper, gold, coal, oil, and natural gas. The Multi-Stakeholder Group selected these counties, or in some cases clusters of counties, based on their recent high levels of production, range of changes in production over ten years, and geographic diversity.</p>

      <p>Each county narrative provides historical context, commodity production rates, employment levels, revenues generated from production, and—where publically available from a government source—local public fiscal costs stemming from extraction (specifically, transportation/roads, water, reclamation, and emergency services).</p>
