        <h1>About USEITI</h1>

        <p><strong>EITI is an international standard.</strong> The <a href="http://eiti.org/" target="_blank" title="Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative"><strong>Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative</strong></a>, or EITI, is a voluntary, global effort designed to strengthen accountability and public trust for the revenues paid and received for a country's oil, gas and mineral resources. Countries that follow the standard publish a report in which governments and companies publicly disclose royalties, rents, bonuses, taxes and other payments from oil, gas, and mining resources. The Standard has two core elements:</p>

        <h2>1 | Transparency</h2>

        <p>Companies publish what they pay and governments publish what they receive in an EITI Report.</p>

        <h2>2 | Accountability</h2>

        <p>This process is overseen by a multi-stakeholder group of governments, companies and civil society.</p>

        <p><strong>The United States is committed to implementing the EITI Standard.</strong> In September 2011, the U.S. announced that it would begin the multi-year process of becoming an EITI Compliant country. The U.S. intends to implement EITI to provide accessible and useful information about public resources and their associated revenues. Doing so will bolster the social license to operate and strengthen the investment climate for extractive industries. Public policy will be better informed, and public trust will be strengthened. With this effort in participatory government and collaborative decision-making, public financial management will be enhanced and citizens will ensure that the government receives a fair return for the public resources it manages on their behalf. <a href="/static/docs/USEITI-Fact-Sheet-February-2015.pdf">Download factsheet.</a></p>

        <p><strong>Initial Steps.</strong> In December 2012, following a comprehensive stakeholder assessment and call for nominations, the Secretary of the Interior formed the USEITI Multi-Stakeholder Group <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104514?utm_source=OGP&amp;utm_medium=print-radio&amp;utm_term=faca&amp;utm_campaign=shortcuts" target="_blank">Federal Advisory Committee</a>, also known as the MSG. The USEITI MSG is comprised of 21 members and 20 alternates who represent a variety of stakeholders. The USEITI MSG has met several times since February 2013 to oversee EITI implementation, define the scope and materiality for initial USEITI reporting, and prepare an application for EITI candidacy. On December 11, 2013, the MSG approved the U.S. Candidacy Application, and on December 19, 2013, Secretary of the Interior submitted the Application to the EITI International Board.</p>

      <h2>Twelve county narratives</h2>

      <p>While extractive industries make up a small but important part of the national economy in the U.S. at 2.6% of 2013 GDP, in some local communities, extractive industries play a much larger role. For example,  <a href="#wyoming-gdp" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">extractive industries make up more than a third (37%) of the State of Wyoming’s GDP.</a> At the county level, certain communities and local economies can be even more dependent on extractive industries.</p>

      <p>This section provides a snapshot into twelve communities that, over about the last decade, have led U.S. counties in production of one of the following resources: iron, copper, gold, coal, oil, and natural gas. These counties, or in some cases clusters of counties given geological formations, were selected based on their recent high levels of production. We hope this will help you understand the economic and fiscal effects of oil, gas, and mineral extraction on local communities, including revenue sustainability.</p>

      <h3>Choose a community to get started</h3>

      <ul class="communities-choose">
        <li>Gas: <a href="/communities/tar">Tarrant &amp; Johnson Counties, Texas</a></li>
        <li>Oil: <a href="/communities/nor">North Slope Borough, Alaska</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Or, read more about how to interpret these studies:</h3>

      <h3><a name="reven">Revenue Sustainability</a></h3>

      <p>Local governments and communities must consider the many ways natural resource management and extraction can affect their fiscal health. One of the most significant considerations is the sustainability of the revenues local governments receive due to natural resource extraction. Multiple EITI guiding principles reference revenue sustainability as a critical factor in making natural resource wealth <a href="#eiti-engine" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">&ldquo;an engine for sustainable economic growth.&rdquo;</a> However, when it comes to managing this critical factor, there are two challenges localities need to address:</p>

      <ol class="decimal list-para">
        <li>The sustainability of revenues over time, given that revenues fluctuate with commodity prices and fossil fuels and hard rock mineral deposits are finite or not economically extractable based on current technology.</li>
        <li>The net sustainability of revenues given the fiscal benefits from increased revenues from extractive activities, and the fiscal costs from increased government expenditures necessary to support extractive activities.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Each county narrative provides historical context, commodity production rates, employment levels, revenues generated from production, and—where publically available from a government source—local public fiscal costs stemming from extraction (specifically, transportation/roads, water, reclamation, and emergency services).</p>

      <h3><a name="county-rev">Community Revenues</a></h3>

      <p>At the county level, revenues received from extractive activities take many forms. For example, some payments originate from taxes on land ownership, while others are based on ownership of the natural resource itself. There are also different methods of valuation, ranging from payments at the point-of-sale, to annual taxes, to those based on an estimated value. For the purposes of this report, the four most common categories are: property taxes, sales and use taxes, state transfer payments, and additional production taxes.</p>

      <ul class="bullet list-para">
        <li><strong>Property taxes/ad valorem.</strong> Taxes paid by private owners of oil and gas or mineral property to the county government based on the value of the property.</li>
        <li><strong>Sales and use taxes.</strong> Though not a direct result of natural resource extraction, revenues from sales and use taxes can rise dramatically during resource extraction booms when population and economic activity increase.</li>
        <li><strong>State transfer payments.</strong> Revenues transferred to the county by the state that come from sources such as <strong>severance taxes</strong> paid by extractives industries to the state based on the volume and/or value of the resources extracted, and <strong>lease payments</strong>, such as bonuses, rents, and royalties, paid by the extractive industries to a public land and mineral owner, either the Federal Government or the state.</li>
        <li><strong>County production taxes.</strong> Severance taxes or other payments paid by extractive industries to the county based on the volume or value of resources extracted, or per lease terms if the county is the landowner.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><a name="county-cos">Community Costs</a></h3>

      <p>More often than not, local governments must also make financial investments in their communities to support the extractive industries. These can vary based on the size of the community, the state of its current infrastructure, and the type of natural resources extracted (e.g., coal mining vs. natural gas drilling). <a href="#local-gov-costs-rev" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">In some circumstances, these costs are outweighed by the influx of revenues, while in other cases costs can result in net negative fiscal effects on local governments.</a> Given these possibilities and considerations, these case studies focus on four types of fiscal costs at the local level:</p>

      <ul class="bullet list-para">
        <li><strong>Transportation.</strong> The cost of constructing new transportation infrastructure (e.g., roads or trains) or repairing current infrastructure due to heavy industry use.</li>
        <li><strong>Water</strong> The cost of constructing new water or sewer infrastructure (e.g., water pipelines, treatment plants, etc.) to meet the needs of the extractive industries, upgrading current infrastructure, or treating additional wastewater from extractive activities in the public wastewater treatment system.</li>
        <li><strong>Reclamation.</strong> The cost of returning mines or oil and gas lands to their state prior to disturbance, including physical site stability and ecosystem functions, and long-term site monitoring.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Services.</strong> The cost of new emergency services (e.g., firehouses, ambulances, chemical spill equipment, etc.) needed to support extractives industries and protect the public from possible health and safety hazards.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There are additional fiscal benefits and burdens associated with extractive activities than those addressed in this report. For example, a local government may receive in-kind revenues from the extractive industries, such as payment for a new public road that company employees will also use to access work sites. Another fiscal cost may be the additional government staff needed to manage growing public services required to support extractive activities. While all are worthy of careful consideration by local communities and governments, this year’s report begins this discussion by focusing on the revenues and costs as defined above.</p>

      <h3><a name="data">Where We Got Our Data</a></h3>

      <p>This work used a range of publically-available online information to write these community case studies, including government databases, documents, and reports, as well as those produced by government councils. They integrate data and analysis already reported elsewhere by government bodies. Local data sources were prioritized, and data was collected and presented at the most granular level available. For example, state information took the place of county information when the latter was not available.</p>

      <p>County and state budget documents and state agency websites were the primary data sources. Federal agency websites and reports also provided critical information on employment in the extractives industries, proved reserves of various natural resources, and production estimates. Any non-governmental sources used were approved by the Multi-Stakeholder Group that together guides the USEITI process.</p>
