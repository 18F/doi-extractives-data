      <h2><a name="intro">North Slope Borough, Alaska</a></h2>

      <p><a href="#barrel-units" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">The United States has experienced something of a renaissance in domestic oil production since 2008, when crude oil production reached a low of 3.98 million bbl/day.</a> <a href="#production-exceeds-imports" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">Fast forward five years, and the U.S. has nearly doubled its daily production output, with Texas and North Dakota driving much of the growth.</a>  <a href="#crude-production" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">Alaska, the fourth largest state producer of crude oil in 2013, did not experience the same production boom, with crude oil output in steady decline over the past decade.</a> <a href="#boroughs" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">In spite of that downward trend, the nation’s single largest producing county is Alaska’s North Slope Borough.</a></p>

      <h3><a name="geolo">Geology and History</a></h3>

      <p>The North Slope Borough is the country’s largest organized local jurisdiction, spanning over 94,000 miles north of the Arctic Circle. <a href="#borough-population" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">Its 9,686 residents, most of whom are Inupiat Alaskan Natives, are spread across eight separate communities.</a> The northern coast of Alaska was documented as a potential oil-producing region as early as 1900. <a href="#petroleum-reserve" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">However, the borough government was not formally incorporated until 1972, soon after the discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay, the largest single oil field in North America.</a></p>
      <p>Oil production increased dramatically in 1977 with the opening of the Alaska Pipeline, which provided the first economically-viable way to transport large amounts of crude oil from the North Slope to market. In 1994, ARCO identified another significant deposit at the Alpine Field, located within the federally-administered National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska. The North Slope’s Prudhoe Bay and the Alpine Field constitute the majority of the state of Alaska’s oil production. <a href="#oilgas-tech-report" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">Today, the borough’s oil reserve base is extensive, with approximately six billion barrels of proved oil.</a></p>

      <h3><a name="produ">Production</a></h3>

      <p><a href="#energy-info-administration" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">In 2013, the North Slope Borough produced 182.5 million bbl of oil, on both state-owned and federal land.</a> Since production at Prudhoe Bay commenced, all of the North Slope’s extraction has taken place in the northern portion of the Colville-Canning province, administered by either the Alaska Dept. of Natural Resourcesor the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). <a href="#oilgas-tech-report-2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">Once exclusively dominated by three companies, North Slope exploration and extraction has diversified significantly, with 63 current lease holders from seven countries.</a> <a href="#energy-info-administration-2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">Annual oil production in the borough peaked in 1988 at 722 million bbl and has steadily declined since that time.</a></p>

      <h3><a name="emplo">Employment</a></h3>

      <p>The oil industry is a key driver of jobs throughout the borough. <a href="#annual-average-employment" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">In 2013, oil and gas extraction provided 1,768 jobs on the North Slope, accounting for 14.3% of total private jobs (12,340).</a> Since the North Slope Borough’s population is less than 10,000, however, it follows that many of the private jobs are filled by non-residents. <a href="#ak-non-residents" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">In 2013, nonresidents accounted for 33.6% of oil industry workers in Alaska, up from 31.6% in 2012.</a> <a href="#regional-energy-plan" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">The North Slope Borough government itself remains the largest employer of local North Slope residents, along with the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, school district, and local Native corporations.</a></p>

      <h3><a name="reven">Revenues</a></h3>

      <p>Given the North Slope’s relative geographic isolation, oil revenues are critical forsupporting local schools, health centers, fire stations, water and sanitation facilities, and infrastructure. <a href="#comprehensive-annual-finances" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">In 2013, the North Slope government received $470 million in revenues. Of those revenues, the borough received $332 million from local property taxes, 98% of which were levied on oil- and gas-related property.</a> <a href="#2013-annual-report" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">At the state level, the Alaskan government collects oil-related revenues for the benefit of the public via four mechanisms:</a></p>
      <p>□ Oil and gas production tax at 35% of the net value of extracted oil and gas. Revenues are deposited in the state’s General Fund, with payments received after a tax assessment deposited in the Constitutional Budget Reserve Fund (CBRE). In 2013, the state received over $4 billion in revenues from this tax.</p> 
      <p>□ Oil and gas property tax on the value of taxable exploration, production, and pipeline transportation property, set at 20 mills or 2% of the assessed value. This revenue is also deposited in the state’s General Fund, with payments received after a tax assessment deposited in the CBRE.</p>
      <p>□ Royalties assessed on state-owned land leased for oil production. In 2013, $856 million was deposited in the Alaska Permanent Fund and School Fund, and an additional $177 million flowed to the Constitutional Budget Reserve Fund from royalty settlements.16</p>
      
      <p>Oil and gas corporate net income tax is set at a maximum of 9.4% on Alaskan income over $90,000. In 2013, $434 million was deposited in the state’s General Fund from this tax.Alaskan residents also receive annual dividend payments from the state’s Permanent Fund, based on a five-year average of the Fund’s performance. The state established the Permanent Fund in 1976 as construction of the Alaska Pipeline concluded. Twenty-five percent of revenues from mineral leases on state-owned lands and from federal mineral revenue-sharing payments go into the Permanent Fund for investment. In 2013, Alaskan residents each received $900 as a result of this payout.17</p>
