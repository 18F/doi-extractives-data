    <h2 class="h3">Scope</h2>

    <p>This dataset includes natural resource disbursements for U.S. federal lands and offshore areas, and Indian Lands. It does not include privately-owned lands, or U.S. state lands. The dataset is tracked and managed by the Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue. </p>

    <h2 class="h3">Data Publication</h2>

    <p>The disbursement dataset is updated in December after the end of the federal government fiscal year.  </p>

    <h2>Data Dictionary</h2>

    <p>Laws treat revenues from offshore natural resources and onshore natural resources differently. There are set percentages and amounts from each that go certain places every year.</p>

    <h3>Onshore</h3>

    <p><strong>U.S. Treasury.</strong> Funds disbursed to the Treasury go to the General Fund, which is the federal government’s basic operating fund. The General Fund pays for roughly two-thirds of all federal expenditures, including the US military, national parks, and schools.</p>

    <p><strong>States.</strong> Funds disbursed to states fall under the jurisdiction of each state, and each state determines how the funds will be used.</p>

    <p><strong>Reclamation.</strong> Established by Congress in 1902 to pay for Bureau of Reclamation projects, this fund supports the establishment of critical infrastructure projects like dams and power plants.</p>

    <p><strong>American Indian Tribes.</strong> ONRR disburses 100% of revenue collected from resource extraction on American Indian lands back to the Indian tribes and individual Indian landowners.</p>

    <p><strong>Other.</strong> Certain onshore funds are directed back to the federal agencies that administer these lands (e.g., BLM, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and US Forest Service) to help cover the agencies’ operational costs. The Ultra-Deepwater Research Program and the Mescal Settlement Agreement also receive $50 million each.</p>

    <h3>Offshore</h3>

    <p><strong>U.S. Treasury.</strong> The majority of offshore revenue is disbursed to the Treasury, which enters it into the General Fund, the federal government’s basic operating fund. The General Fund pays for roughly two-thirds of all federal expenditures, including the US military, national parks, and schools.</p>

    <p><strong>Land and Water Conservation Fund.</strong> This fund provides matching grants to states and local governments to buy and develop public outdoor recreation areas across the 50 states.</p>

    <p><strong>Historic Preservation Fund.</strong> This fund helps preserve US historical and archaeological sites and cultural heritage through grants to state and tribal historic preservation offices.</p>

    <p><strong>States.</strong> States receive federal Outer Continental Shelf revenue in two ways:
        <ol class="list-decimal">
            <li>27% of revenue from leases in the 8(g) Zone (the first three nautical miles of the Outer Continental Shelf) are shared with states; and</li>
            <li>37.5% of revenue from certain leases in the Gulf of Mexico are shared with Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Other.</strong> Certain offshore funds are directed back to the federal agencies that administer these lands (e.g., BOEM and BSEE) to help cover the agencies’ operational costs.</p>
