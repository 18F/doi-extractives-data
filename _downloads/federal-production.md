    <h2>Documentation</h2>

    <p>The datasets contains production information for calendar years 2005-2014 as of July 11, 2015 for coal and hardrock production and August 25, 2015 for Oil and Gas production. If you are looking for datasets organized by the U.S. government’s fiscal year, please visit <a href="http://statistics.onrr.gov/">statistics.onrr.gov</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>These datasets include natural resource production for U.S. federal lands and offshore areas. It does not include Indian lands, privately-owned lands, or U.S. state lands. The datasets currently include data tracked and managed by the Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR). The production data for Oil and Gas is collected on Form ONRR-4054 (Oil and Gas Operations Report), Coal and hardrock production is collected on Form ONRR-4430 (Solid Minerals Production and Royalty Report).</p>
    
    <h3>Data Publication</h3>
    
    <p>The production data set is updated six months after the end of the year. Fiscal year 2015 data will be published in March 2016 and calendar year 2015 data will be published in June 2016. </p>

    <p><strong>Why was some solids data withheld?</strong></p>
    
    <p>ONRR withheld some solids production information out of an abundance of caution to ensure that there were no violations of the Trade Secrets Act. </p>
    
    <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>"W" is displayed in the Production Volume column for those products that reveal proprietary data at the county level </li>
        <li>All "W" volumes are accounted for in separate line totals where state and county have been "Withheld" (columns C, D and E)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Offshore data dictionary</h3>
    
    <p>The offshore dataset is organized by offshore planning areas. There are more offshore planning areas than are represented in our data. Those not represented had no production during the time period. For more information on offshore planning areas, including spatial boundaries, see the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) <a href="http://www.boem.gov/Maps-and-GIS-Data/">maps and GIS data</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>FIPS Code</h3>
    
    <p>Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code is a five-digit code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the U.S., certain U.S. possessions, and certain freely associated states. The first two digits are the FIPS state code and the last three are the county code within the state or possession.</p>

    <h3>Region</h3>
    
    <p>BOEM separates offshore area into four regions: Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, Pacific, and Alaska. For more information on offshore regions, including spatial boundaries, see BOEM's <a href="http://www.boem.gov/Maps-and-GIS-Data/">maps and GIS data</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Planning Area</h3>
    
    <p>Offshore regions are broken out into planning areas. For more information on offshore planning areas, including spatial boundaries, see BOEM's <a href="http://www.boem.gov/Maps-and-GIS-Data/">maps and GIS data</a>.</p>
